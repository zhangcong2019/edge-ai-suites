# Edge AI UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) Platform

> This SDK is intended as a development kit and reference solution for evaluating Intel Edge AI capabilities on UAV platforms.

Multi-camera UAV simulation with Intel Edge AI — PX4 + Gazebo + OpenVINO vision processing.

## Where to Start

| I want to… | Go here |
|---|---|
| Run the demo end-to-end | [Quick Start](#quick-start) below |
| Understand the full architecture | [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Configure cameras, switch USB/sim | [docs/CAMERA-MODES.md](docs/CAMERA-MODES.md) |
| See all ports and services | [docs/PORTS.md](docs/PORTS.md) |
| Connect a real PX4 over Ethernet | [docs/ETHERNET-PX4.md](docs/ETHERNET-PX4.md) |
| Troubleshoot a broken stack | [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) |

---

## Prerequisites

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **Docker Engine** 24+ and Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose version`)
- **Intel GPU** for vision inference
- **RAM**: 16 GB minimum (sim mode); 8 GB sufficient for USB camera mode
- **Disk**: ~15 GB for Docker images

```bash
# Verify Intel GPU render nodes are present
ls /dev/dri/renderD*
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create .env and detect GPU devices
make init

# 2. Start core infra (PX4 + Gazebo + camera bridges + MQTT + RTSP + observability)
make up-sim-camera

# 3. Start AI helpers + sample apps
make apps
```

Open **http://localhost:5002**

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for full setup, troubleshooting, and ports.

## What It Does

A PX4 UAV simulation with 3 cameras (nadir, forward, rear) streams live H264 video via RTSP through OpenVINO vehicle detection on Intel GPU. The dashboard shows real-time detections, bounding boxes, and flight telemetry.

## Camera Modes

| Mode | Command | PX4 | Cameras |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simulated (default) | `make up-sim-camera` | Gazebo SITL | 3 virtual cameras (nadir, forward, rear) |
| Real USB camera | `make up-usb-camera` | SIH (no Gazebo) | 1 USB/V4L2 device |

## Key Makefile Targets

```bash
make init                  # Create .env, detect GPU
make up-sim-camera         # Start sim stack (includes Grafana/InfluxDB)
make up-sim-camera-lean    # Start sim stack without observability (~300 MB RAM saved)
make up-usb-camera         # Start USB camera stack
make up-usb-camera-lean    # Start USB camera stack without observability
make apps                  # Start vision processor + dashboard
make apps-down             # Stop apps only
make down                  # Stop all containers
make logs                  # Tail core infra logs
make apps-logs             # Tail app logs
```

## Key Ports

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Edge AI Dashboard | http://localhost:5002 | Live camera feeds, detections, arm/fly/land |
| REST API | http://localhost:8080 | UAV commands (arm, takeoff, land, goto) |
| RTSP Streams | rtsp://localhost:8554/uav-1/{cam} | Raw + annotated video |
| MQTT broker | localhost:1884 | Telemetry + detection events |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 | Flight telemetry + platform health dashboards |
| InfluxDB | http://localhost:8086 | Time-series data UI |

## Disabling Observability (Save ~300 MB RAM)

Grafana, InfluxDB, topic-extractor, and metrics-manager are grouped under the
`observability` profile. They are **on by default** but can be omitted for
tighter memory budgets.

```bash
# Start without observability stack (~300 MB RAM saved)
make up-sim-camera-lean    # sim cameras, no Grafana/InfluxDB
make up-usb-camera-lean    # USB camera, no Grafana/InfluxDB

# Standard start includes observability (default)
make up-sim-camera         # includes Grafana + InfluxDB
```

Or stop observability on an already-running stack:
```bash
docker compose stop grafana influxdb topic-extractor metrics-manager
```

**View live camera**: `ffplay rtsp://localhost:8554/uav-1/nadir`
