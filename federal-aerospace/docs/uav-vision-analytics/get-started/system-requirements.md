> **Note:** Users can also create apps tailored to their use case using models supported by DL Streamer.
Check [the list of supported models](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/supported_models.html) for the latest information.

## Software Requirements

**Required Software**:

- Docker 27.3.1 or higher
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- `ffmpeg` (for RTSP stream playback and recording)
- `python3.12-venv` (for creating a Python virtual environment)

> `python3.12-venv` is required by `make model` to create a Python virtual environment.
> `ffmpeg` provides `ffplay` for viewing the RTSP output stream and `ffmpeg` for recording.

<!--
## Compatibility Notes
**Known Limitations**:
- GPU optimizations require Intel® integrated graphics or compatible accelerators.
