# Containers description

## Weld data simulator

The **Weld Data Simulator** module in the `Multimodal weld defect detection` sample app uses the sets of time synchronized .avi and .csv files, subset of test dataset coming from [Intel_Robotic_Welding_Multimodal_Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amr-lopezjos/Intel_Robotic_Welding_Multimodal_Dataset).
It ingests the .avi files as RTSP streams via the **mediamtx** server. This enables real-time video ingestion, simulating camera feeds for weld defect detection.
Similarly, it ingests the .csv files as data points into **Telegraf** using the **MQTT** protocol.

## Fusion Analytics

The **Fusion Analytics** module in the `Multimodal weld defect detection` sample app subscribes to the MQTT topics coming out of `DL Streamer Pipeline Server` and `Time Series Analytics Microservice`, applies `AND`/`OR` logic to determine the anomalies during weld process, publishes the results over MQTT and writes the results as a measurement/table in **InfluxDB**

## Insights Workbench

The **Insights Workbench** module in the `Multimodal weld defect detection` sample app is a small Flask web app that powers the dashboard. It reads fused inspection results and related sensor/vision data from InfluxDB, shows them in a paginated UI, and can call a vLLM backend to generate an AI explanation from selected timestamps

## Multimodal Agentic UI

The **Multimodal Agentic UI** module in the `Multimodal weld defect detection` sample app is the FastAPI web frontend for the manufacturing `Agentic Weld Quality Analysis`` demo. It serves the main dashboard, a detections view, and a results page.
