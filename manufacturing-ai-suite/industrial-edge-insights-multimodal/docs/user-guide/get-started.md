# Get Started

- **Time to Complete:** 30 minutes
- **Programming Language:**  Python 3

## Prerequisites

- [System Requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md)

## Configure Docker

To configure Docker:

1. **Run Docker as Non-Root**: Follow the steps in
   [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).
2. **Configure Proxy (if required)**:
   - Set up proxy settings for Docker client and containers as described in
     [Docker Proxy Configuration](https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/proxy/).
   - Example `~/.docker/config.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "proxies": {
         "default": {
           "httpProxy": "http://<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>",
           "httpsProxy": "http://<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>",
           "noProxy": "127.0.0.1,localhost"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - Configure the Docker daemon proxy as per
     [Systemd Unit File](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/proxy/#systemd-unit-file).
3. **Enable Log Rotation**:
   - Add the following configuration to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

     ```json
     {
       "log-driver": "json-file",
       "log-opts": {
         "max-size": "10m",
         "max-file": "5"
       }
     }
     ```

   - Reload and restart Docker:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

## Clone source code

Go to the target directory of your choice and clone the suite.
If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `main` with the desired tag.
To learn more on partial cloning, check the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch release-2026.2.0 https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
cd edge-ai-suites
git sparse-checkout set manufacturing-ai-suite
cd manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
```

## Deploy with Docker Compose

1. Update the following fields in `.env`.

   - `INFLUXDB_USERNAME`
   - `INFLUXDB_PASSWORD`
   - `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER`
   - `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
   - `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME`
   - `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD`
   - `HOST_IP`
   - `S3_STORAGE_USERNAME`
   - `S3_STORAGE_PASSWORD`

2. Deploy the sample app, use only one of the following options.

   > **NOTE:**
   >
   > - The below `make up` fails if the above required fields are not populated
   >   as per the rules called out in `.env` file.
   > - The sample app is deployed by pulling the pre-built container images of the sample app
   >   from the docker hub OR from the internal container registry (login to the docker registry from cli and configure `DOCKER_REGISTRY`
   >   env variable in `.env` file at `edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal`)
   > - The `CONTINUOUS_SIMULATOR_INGESTION` variable in the `.env` file (for Docker Compose) is set to `true` by default,
   >   enabling continuous looping of simulator data. To ingest the simulator data only once (without looping),
   >   set this variable to `false`.
   > - The update rate of the graph and table may lag by a few seconds and might not perfectly align with the video stream, since
   >   Grafana’s minimum refresh interval is 5 seconds.
   > - The graph and table may initially display "No Data" because the Time Series Analytics Microservice requires some time to
   >   install its dependency packages before it can start running.
   > - Fusion Analytics starts once the RTP sender timestamp is available in the metadata packet from the DL Streamer Pipeline Server.
   > - **Known issue:** DL Streamer Pipeline Server may not send RTP sender timestamps for the first ~300 packets.
   >   This may result in a delay before Fusion Analytics becomes fully operational.

   ```bash
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
   make up
   ```

3. Use the following command to verify that all containers are active and error-free.

   > **Note:** The command `make status` may show errors in containers like ia-grafana when the user has not logged in
   > for the first login OR due to session timeout. Just login again in Grafana and functionality wise if things are working, then
   > ignore `user token not found` errors along with other minor errors which may show up in Grafana logs.

   ```sh
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
   make status
   ```

### Running Time Series Analytics Microservice User Defined Function(UDF) inference on GPU

By default, UDF for Time Series Analytics Microservice is configured to run on `CPU`.

To trigger the UDF inference on `GPU` in Time Series Analytics Microservice, run the following command:

```sh
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal/configs/time-series-analytics-microservice
curl -k -X 'POST' \
 'https://localhost:3000/ts-api/config' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d "$(sed 's/"device": "CPU"/"device": "GPU"/' config.json)"
```

### Running DL Streamer Pipeline Server model inference on GPU or NPU

By default, model for DL Streamer Pipeline Server is configured to run on `CPU`.
To trigger the model inference on `GPU` in DL Streamer Pipeline Server, run the following command:

- To run inference on with GPU,

  ```sh
  cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal/configs/dlstreamer-pipeline-server

  for id in $(curl -k --location https://localhost:3000/dsps-api/pipelines/status \
  | grep -oP '"id":\s*"\K[^"]+'); do
      curl -k --location -X DELETE "https://localhost:3000/dsps-api/pipelines/$id"
  done;

  curl -k https://localhost:3000/dsps-api/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_defect_classification \
    -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "$(sed 's/"device": "CPU"/"device": "GPU"/' pipeline-request-cpu.json)"
  ```

- To run inference on `NPU`, use:

  > **Note:** Ensure NPU support is available on your platform before running NPU inference.

  ```sh
  cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal/configs/dlstreamer-pipeline-server

  for id in $(curl -k --location https://localhost:3000/dsps-api/pipelines/status \
  | grep -oP '"id":\s*"\K[^"]+'); do
    curl -k --location -X DELETE "https://localhost:3000/dsps-api/pipelines/$id"
  done;

  curl -k https://localhost:3000/dsps-api/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_defect_classification \
    -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "$(sed 's/"device": "CPU"/"device": "NPU"/' pipeline-request-cpu.json)"
  ```


> **Note:** When stopping the pipeline, Grafana may display the error message: **"Error: stream not found, retrying in some seconds"**. This is expected behavior. The stream will automatically reconnect and resume in Grafana once the pipeline is started again.

## Verify the Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Results

1. Get into the InfluxDB* container.

   > **Note:** Use `kubectl exec -it <influxdb-pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/bash` for the helm deployment
   > where for \<namespace> replace with namespace name where the application was deployed and
   > for \<influxdb-pod-name> replace with InfluxDB pod name.

    ```bash
     docker exec -it ia-influxdb bash
    ```

2. Run the following commands to see the data in InfluxDB*.

   > **NOTE:**
   > Please ignore the error message `There was an error writing history file: open /.influx_history: read-only file system` happening in the InfluxDB shell.
   > This does not affect any functionality while working with the InfluxDB commands

   ``` bash
   # For below command, the INFLUXDB_USERNAME and INFLUXDB_PASSWORD needs to be fetched from `.env` file
   influx -username <username> -password <passwd>
   use datain # database access
   show measurements
   # Run below query to check and output measurement processed
   # by Time Series Analytics microservice
   select * from "weld-sensor-anomaly-data"

   # Run below query to check and output measurement processed
   # by DL Streamer pipeline server microservice
   select * from "vision-weld-classification-results"
   ```

3. Check the output in Grafana.

   - Use link `https://localhost:3000` to launch Grafana from browser (preferably, chrome browser)

   > **Note:**
   > - Use link `https://localhost:30001` to launch Grafana from browser (preferably Chrome browser) for the Helm deployment
   > - For remote access, set `HOST_IP` in `.env` to the host system IP address and access `https://<HOST_IP>:3000` (or `https://<HOST_IP>:30001` for Helm).

   - Login to the Grafana with values set for `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER` and `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
     in `.env` file and select **Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Dashboard**.

     ![Grafana login](./_assets/login_wt.png)

   - After login, click on Dashboard
     ![Menu view](./_assets/dashboard.png)

   - Select the `Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Dashboard`.
     ![Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Dashboard](./_assets/grafana_dashboard_selection.png)

   - One will see the below output.
