# Deploy the vLLM Service for Defect Explanation

This section shows how to deploy the multimodal sample application with the vLLM service enabled using the Makefile targets.

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Operating System | Ubuntu OS version 24.04 LTS or later |
| Hardware | Intel® Core™ Ultra Series 3 processor or newer |

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure the `.env` file is configured with valid values for:

   - `HOST_IP`
   - `INFLUXDB_USERNAME`, `INFLUXDB_PASSWORD`
   - `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER`, `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
   - `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME`, `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD`
   - `S3_STORAGE_USERNAME`, `S3_STORAGE_PASSWORD`

## Download Models

This section shows how to download the **`Unsloth Qwen3.5-2B` model and `Unsloth Qwen3.5-2B fine-tuned LoRA` adapter**.

1. Review and accept the [Unsloth Qwen3.5-2B license](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-2B/blob/main/LICENSE) before downloading.

   > **Note:** The [Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapter](https://huggingface.co/Intel/qwen3.5-2b-vlm-weld-explainability-lora) was specifically trained on a subset of the [Intel Robotic Welding Multimodal Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/IntelLabs/Intel_Robotic_Welding_Multimodal_Dataset) and may not generalize to generic weld datasets.

2. Go to the root folder of the multimodal sample app:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
```

3. Download the model and adapter:

```bash
mkdir -p configs/vllm/huggingface configs/vllm/models && \
cd configs/vllm/ && \
rm -rf .modelenv && \
python3 -m venv .modelenv && \
source .modelenv/bin/activate && \
pip3 install huggingface_hub==1.23.0 && \
rm -rf huggingface models && \
hf download unsloth/Qwen3.5-2B \
    --local-dir ./huggingface/Qwen3.5-2B && \
hf download Intel/qwen3.5-2b-vlm-weld-explainability-lora \
    --local-dir ./models/qwen3.5-2b-vlm-weld-explainability-lora && \
deactivate && \
cd ../..
```

## Deploy the vLLM Service

> **Note:** vLLM preallocates GPU-addressable memory up to the limit specified by `VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` [Video Random Access Memory (VRAM) on discrete GPU (dGPU); shared system memory on integrated GPU (iGPU)]. Since the optimal value varies between platforms, update `VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` in the `.env` file to match your target hardware.

1. Run the Makefile target:

```bash
 cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
 make up_vllm
```

2. (Optional) To build from source instead of deploying the pre-built artifacts, run the following for a fresh build before deployment:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
make build
make up_vllm
```

## Verify the Deployment

1. Check the overall stack health:
   
   > **Note:** The command `make status` may show errors in containers like ia-grafana if you have not logged in to Grafana dashboard for the first time, or if your session has timed out. Log in to Grafana dashboard and if the dashboard works correctly, ignore `user token not found` and other minor errors in the Grafana logs.

   ```bash
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
   make status
   ```

2. Confirm that the vLLM container is running:

   ```bash
   docker ps --filter "name=vllm-server"
   ```

3. Inspect vLLM logs:

   ```bash
   docker logs -f vllm-server
   ```

4. Check the output in Grafana dashboard:
   
   - Use the link `https://localhost:3000` to open Grafana dashboard in a browser, preferably the Chrome browser. For Helm deployment, use the link `https://localhost:30001`.
   
   - Log in to Grafana dashboard using the `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER` and `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
     values from the `.env` file:

     ![Grafana login](../_assets/login_wt.png)

   - After logging in, click **Dashboards**:
     ![Menu view](../_assets/dashboard.png)

   - Select **Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Explainability Dashboard**:
     ![Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Explainability Dashboard](../_assets/grafana_dashboard_selection_vllm.png)

   - The following appears:

     ![vLLM Reasoning for weld data](../_assets/vllm_response.png)

## Stop the Deployment

To bring down the full stack:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
make down
```

## Troubleshooting

- `vllm-server` startup delay after deployment
   The `vllm-server` service can take about 10 minutes to fully come up after `make up_vllm`. This is expected while the model is initialized and loaded into memory.

- `Error: configs/vllm/models directory does not exist.`
  Create the directory and place the required model artifacts in it.

- `Error: configs/vllm/models directory is empty.`
  Add model files and checkpoints before running `make up_vllm`.

- `HOST_IP is not set` or `HOST_IP is not a valid IPv4 address format.`
  Update `HOST_IP` in `.env` with a valid IPv4 address.

- Username and password validation failures from `check_env_variables`
  Update `.env` values so they match the Makefile validation rules.
