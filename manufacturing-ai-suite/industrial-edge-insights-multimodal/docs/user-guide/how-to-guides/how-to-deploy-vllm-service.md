# Deploy vLLM Service For Defect Explanation

This guide explains how to deploy the multimodal sample app with the vLLM service enabled using the Makefile targets.

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Operating System | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or later |
| Hardware | Intel® Core™ Ultra Platform (PTL) or newer |

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure `.env` is configured and includes valid values for:

   - `HOST_IP`
   - `INFLUXDB_USERNAME`, `INFLUXDB_PASSWORD`
   - `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER`, `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
   - `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME`, `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD`
   - `S3_STORAGE_USERNAME`, `S3_STORAGE_PASSWORD`

## Download Models

**Download `Unsloth Qwen3.5 2B` model and `Unsloth Qwen 3.5 2B fine tuned LoRA adapter`**

> Please review and accept the [Unsloth Qwen3.5 2B license](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-2B/blob/main/LICENSE) before downloading.
>
> The LoRA adapter was specifically trained on a subset of the [Intel Robotic Welding Multimodal Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/IntelLabs/Intel_Robotic_Welding_Multimodal_Dataset) and may not generalize to generic weld datasets.

```bash
mkdir -p configs/vllm/huggingface configs/vllm/models && \
cd configs/vllm/ && \
rm -rf .modelenv && \
python3 -m venv .modelenv && \
source .modelenv/bin/activate && \
pip3 install huggingface_hub==1.23.0 && \
rm -rf huggingface models && \
hf download unsloth/Qwen3.5-2B \
    --local-dir ./huggingface/Qwen3.5-2B && \
hf download Intel/qwen3.5-2b-vlm-weld-explainability-lora \
    --local-dir ./models/qwen3.5-2b-vlm-weld-explainability-lora && \
deactivate && \
cd ../..
```

## Deploy the vLLM Service

> **Note:** vLLM preallocates GPU-addressable memory up to the limit specified by `VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` (VRAM on dGPU, shared system memory on iGPU). Since the optimal value varies between platforms, update `VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` in the `.env` file to match your target hardware.

Run:

```bash
 cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
 make up_vllm
```

For a fresh build before deployment:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
make build
make up_vllm
```

## Verify the Deployment

1. Check overall stack health:

   > **Note:** The command `make status` may show errors in containers like ia-grafana when the user has not logged in
   > for the first login OR due to session timeout. Just login again in Grafana and functionality wise if things are working, then
   > ignore `user token not found` errors along with other minor errors which may show up in Grafana logs.

   ```bash
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
   make status
   ```

2. Confirm the vLLM container is running:

   ```bash
   docker ps --filter "name=vllm-server"
   ```

3. Inspect vLLM logs:

   ```bash
   docker logs -f vllm-server
   ```

4. Check the output in Grafana.

   - Use the link `https://localhost:3000` to open Grafana in a browser (preferably Chrome).

   > **Note:** Use the link `https://localhost:30001` to open Grafana in a browser (preferably Chrome) for the Helm deployment.
   - Log in to Grafana using the values set for `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER` and `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
     in the `.env` file, then select **Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Explainability Dashboard**.

     ![Grafana login](../_assets/login_wt.png)

   - After logging in, click **Dashboard**.
     ![Menu view](../_assets/dashboard.png)

   - Select **Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Explainability Dashboard**.
     ![Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Explainability Dashboard](../_assets/grafana_dashboard_selection_vllm.png)

   - You should see the following output:

## Stop the Deployment

To bring down the full stack:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
make down
```

## Troubleshooting

- `vllm-server` startup delay after deployment
   The `vllm-server` service can take about 10 minutes to fully come up after `make up_vllm`. This is expected while the model is initialized and loaded into memory.

- `Error: configs/vllm/models directory does not exist.`
  Create the directory and place the required model artifacts in it.

- `Error: configs/vllm/models directory is empty.`
  Add model files/checkpoints before running `make up_vllm`.

- `HOST_IP is not set` or `HOST_IP is not a valid IPv4 address format.`
  Update `HOST_IP` in `.env` with a valid IPv4 address.

- Username/password validation failures from `check_env_variables`
  Update `.env` values so they match the Makefile validation rules.
