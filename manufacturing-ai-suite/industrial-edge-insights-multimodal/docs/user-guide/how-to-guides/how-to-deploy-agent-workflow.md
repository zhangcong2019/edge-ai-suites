# Deploy the Agentic Workflow for the Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Sample App

This guide explains how to deploy the multimodal sample app with the agentic workflow enabled. The agentic stack adds a meta-agent powered by an LLM (via OVMS) that reacts to fusion results and produces structured policy decisions, root-cause analysis, evidence audit trails, and maintenance tickets.

## Architecture Overview

The agentic workflow is implemented as a **LangGraph-based sequential multi-agent pipeline**. The `apm-agent` acts as the workflow orchestrator, triggering the workflow when new fusion results are received. It coordinates the execution of specialized agents, each responsible for a distinct stage of reasoning. Each agent consumes the shared execution context together with outputs from previous stages, producing traceable intermediate artifacts and a final maintenance recommendation.

| Agent | Input | Output |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Policy Agent** | Fusion results (`fusion_result`) filtered according to the configured analysis thresholds. Uses `fused_decision`, `fusion_confidence`, modality confidence scores, anomaly indicators, and timestamp alignment (`vision_rtsp_ts_diff_ms`). | Structured policy violation report containing the detected defect class, fusion and modality confidence scores, alignment quality, and preliminary priority. Policy decisions are based on `fusion_mode` and configured severity rules. |
| **Analysis Agent** | Policy violations together with fusion, vision, and time-series classifications for the detection window. | Root-cause analysis identifying the dominant defect, explaining conflicts between fusion and modality-specific classifications, and providing operational recommendations based on confidence and anomaly evidence. |
| **Evidence Agent** | Fusion records selected according to the configured evidence criteria (evidence_fields, confidence threshold, and maximum record count). | Formal audit report containing an evidence summary, detailed evidence table, modality agreement status, time synchronization quality, and a deterministic evidence conclusion supporting the final decision. |
| **Ticketing Agent** | Policy evaluation and root-cause analysis results. | Structured maintenance ticket containing the priority, title, description, affected component (if available), recommended action, estimated resolution time, and defect class tags. Ticket priority and escalation follow the configured ticketing rules. |

> **Note:** The `[SYSTEM]` prompt provides shared domain knowledge, including the canonical defect taxonomy, label normalization rules, and available fusion data. It establishes the common reasoning context for all agents and is **not** a separate execution stage.


## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Operating System | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or later |
| Hardware | Intel® Core™ Ultra Series 3 Platform or newer |


## Prerequisites

1. Ensure `.env` is configured with valid values for:

   - `HOST_IP`
   - `INFLUXDB_USERNAME`, `INFLUXDB_PASSWORD`
   - `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER`, `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
   - `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME`, `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD`
   - `S3_STORAGE_USERNAME`, `S3_STORAGE_PASSWORD`

2. Download VLM model by following this [Guide](./how-to-deploy-vllm-service.md#download-models)

## Deploying the Agentic Workflow

Run the full agentic stack (downloads the LLM model first, then starts all containers):

> **Note:** Model download time varies depending on network speed and hardware.
> The service is polled every 5 seconds for up to 50 minutes.


```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
make up_agentic
```

For a fresh build before deployment:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
make build
make up_agentic
```

## Configure the Agent

### Use-Case Config

The agent behavior is controlled by `configs/agentic/agents.yaml`:

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `analysis.detection_schema` | `fusion_result` | Instructs the agent to read `fusion_result` records rather than raw bounding-box detections |
| `analysis.min_confidence` | `0.5` | Minimum `fusion_confidence` to include a record in the analysis window |
| `analysis.max_detections_per_run` | `1000` | Maximum number of `fusion_result` records fetched per run |
| `policy.alert_threshold` | `0.75` | `fusion_confidence` threshold to raise a policy violation |
| `policy.fusion_mode` | `OR` | `AND` requires both modalities anomalous; `OR` triggers on either |
| `policy.critical_classes` | `Burnthrough, Lack of Fusion, Crater Cracks` | Classes that produce `CRITICAL` severity regardless of threshold |
| `evidence.source_measurement` | `fusion_result` | InfluxDB measurement to query for evidence records |
| `evidence.min_fusion_confidence` | `0.6` | Minimum `fusion_confidence` for a record to appear in the evidence table |
| `evidence.max_records_per_evidence` | `100` | Cap on rows included in a single evidence bundle |
| `evidence.evidence_sort` | `time_desc` | Evidence rows are ordered newest-first |
| `ticketing.backend` | `jira` | Ticket destination: `jira`, `servicenow`, or `none` |
| `ticketing.auto_create` | `true` | Submit tickets automatically after each completed run |

#### Defect Class Taxonomy

The policy and ticketing agents operate on the following class hierarchy:

| Priority | Classes |
|----------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Burnthrough, Lack of Fusion, Crater Cracks |
| **HIGH** | Excessive Penetration |
| **MEDIUM** | Porosity, Porosity with Excessive Penetration, Undercut, Spatter, Warping, Overlap, Excessive Convexity |
| **LOW** | No Weld, Good Weld, No Label |

### Prompts

Agent reasoning prompts are in `configs/agentic/prompts/weld-quality-monitoring.txt`. Each `[TAG]` block maps directly to an agent stage:

| Section | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| `[SYSTEM]` | Canonical class labels, label normalization rules (`No_Weld` → `No Weld`, `Good_Weld` → `Good Weld`, `Porosity_w_Excessive_Penetration` → `Porosity with Excessive Penetration`), and available fusion fields |
| `[POLICY]` | How violations are identified: `fusion_confidence` as primary signal; `fused_decision + both anomalies` escalates severity; `vision_rtsp_ts_diff_ms` thresholds classify time-sync quality (`≤50 ms` GOOD, `50–100 ms` WARN, `>100 ms` BAD) |
| `[ANALYSIS]` | Root-cause correlation between `vision_classification` and `timeseries_classification`; resolution of modality conflicts using confidence evidence |
| `[EVIDENCE]` | Three-section output: Summary → Table (all 15 schema fields) → Conclusion; rows annotated with `AGREED`/`DISAGREED` and `GOOD`/`WARN`/`BAD` time-sync status |
| `[TICKETING]` | escalation rules tied to class + `fusion_confidence` threshold (`CRITICAL` at ≥0.8 for critical classes, `HIGH` for Excessive Penetration at ≥0.75) |

### Fallback Policy

`configs/agentic/policy_fallback.json` defines per-class thresholds and actions used when `LLM_MODE=fallback`. Available actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `HALT_LINE` | Stop the production line immediately |
| `REDUCE_HEAT_INPUT` | Reduce welding current/power |
| `SCHEDULE_INSPECTION` | Flag for next-shift inspection |
| `ADJUST_PARAMETERS` | Adjust process parameters |
| `CHECK_FIXTURING` | Check part fixturing and alignment |
| `MONITOR` | Continue monitoring without action |
| `CONTINUE` | No action required |

## Verify the Deployment

1. Check overall stack health:

   ```bash
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-multimodal
   make status
   ```

2. Confirm the agentic containers are running:

   ```bash
   docker ps --filter "name=apm-"
   ```

   Expected containers:
   - `apm-agent` — LangGraph meta-agent
   - `apm-llm` — OVMS LLM server
   - `apm-ui` — web dashboard
   - `apm-metrics` — Prometheus metrics collector (if enabled)

3. Inspect agent logs:

   ```bash
   docker logs -f apm-agent
   ```

4. Check the output in Grafana.

   - Use the link `https://localhost:3000` to open Grafana in a browser (preferably Chrome).

   > **Note:** Use the link `https://localhost:30001` to open Grafana in a browser (preferably Chrome) for the Helm deployment.
   - Log in to Grafana using the values set for `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_USER` and `VISUALIZER_GRAFANA_PASSWORD`
     in the `.env` file, then select **Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Explainability Dashboard**.

     ![Grafana login](../_assets/login_wt.png)

   - After logging in, click **Dashboard**.
     ![Menu view](../_assets/grafana_agentic_dashboard.png)

   - Select **Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Explainability Dashboard**.
     ![Multimodal Weld Defect Detection Agentic Dashboard](../_assets/agentic_dashboard_view.png)

   - You should see the following output:
