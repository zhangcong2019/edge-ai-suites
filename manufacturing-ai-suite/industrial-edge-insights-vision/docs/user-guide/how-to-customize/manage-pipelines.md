# Manage Pipelines in Vision AI Detection Apps

This section describes how to create custom AI pipelines for the sample application and the commands to manage these pipelines.

## Create Pipelines

The AI pipelines are defined by the `pipeline-server-config.json` file present under the configs subdirectory of a particular application directory (for Docker Compose deployment) and similarly inside the Helm directory (for Helm based deployment).

<!--hide_directive ::::{tab-set} hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **Pallet Defect Detection**
<!--hide_directive :sync: pallet-detect hide_directive-->

The following is an example of the pallet defect detection pipeline, which is included in the `pipeline-server-config.json` file.

```sh
    "pipelines": [
    {
        "name": "pallet_defect_detection",
        "source": "gstreamer",
        "queue_maxsize": 50,
        "pipeline": "{auto_source} name=source ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! gvadetect name=detection model-instance-id=inst0 ! queue ! gvawatermark ! gvafpscounter ! gvametaconvert add-empty-results=true name=metaconvert ! gvametapublish name=destination ! appsink name=appsink",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "detection-properties": {
                    "element": {
                        "name": "detection",
                        "format": "element-properties"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "auto_start": false,
        "publish_frame": true
    },
```

<!--hide_directive ::: hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **PCB Anomaly Detection**
<!--hide_directive :sync: pcb-detect hide_directive-->

The following is an example of the PCB anomaly detection pipeline, which is included in the `pipeline-server-config.json` file.

```sh
    "pipelines": [
    {
        "name": "pcb_anomaly_detection",
        "source": "gstreamer",
        "queue_maxsize": 50,
        "pipeline": "{auto_source} name=source ! decodebin ! gvaclassify name=classification inference-region=full-frame pre-process-config=reverse_input_channels=yes device=CPU pre-process-backend=opencv model-instance-id=inst0 ! queue ! gvawatermark ! gvafpscounter ! appsink name=destination",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "classification-properties": {
                    "element": {
                        "name": "classification",
                        "format": "element-properties"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "auto_start": false,
        "publish_frame": true
    },
```

Customize the pipeline according to your needs. For details, see the following DL Streamer Pipeline Server documentation:

- [Launch configurable pipelines](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/how-to-guides/launch-configurable-pipelines.html)
- [Autostart pipelines](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/how-to-guides/autostart-pipelines.html)

## Start the Pipeline

> **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of the application, ensure to provide `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` number in the URL for the app instance, i.e., replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`
> If you are running a single instance and using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

Follow this procedure to start the pipeline.

1. In the `pipeline-server-config.json` file, identify the name of the pipeline you want to start.

   The name of the pipeline is defined by the **name** parameter.

   ```text
   "pipelines": [
       {
             "name": "pipeline_name",
             "source": "....",
             "pipeline": "...."
             "..."
       }
    ]
   ```

2. Use a Client URL (cURL) command to start the pipeline.

   <!--hide_directive ::::{tab-set} hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **Pallet Defect Detection**
   <!--hide_directive :sync: pallet-detect hide_directive-->

   Start this pipeline with the following cURL command.

   ```bash
   curl -k https://<HOST_IP>/api/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pallet_defect_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
       "source": {
           "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
           "type": "uri"
       },
       "parameters": {
           "detection-properties": {
               "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/pallet-defect-detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
               "device": "CPU"
           }
       }
   }'
   ```

   <!--hide_directive ::: hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **PCB Anomaly Detection**
   <!--hide_directive :sync: pcb-detect hide_directive-->

   Start this pipeline with the following cURL command.

   ```sh
   curl -k https://<HOST_IP>/api/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pcb_anomaly_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
       "source": {
           "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/anomalib_pcb_test.avi",
           "type": "uri"
       },
       "parameters": {
           "classification-properties": {
               "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/pcb-anomaly-detection/deployment/Anomaly classification/model/model.xml",
               "device": "CPU"
           }
       }
   }'
   ```

   <!--hide_directive
   :::
   ::::
   hide_directive-->

3. Take note of the instance ID (without quotes).

   Each pipeline has its **instance ID**. You will need the instance ID to stop the pipeline later.

   <!--hide_directive ::::{tab-set} hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **Pallet Defect Detection**
   <!--hide_directive :sync: pallet-detect hide_directive-->

   <!--hide_directive ::: hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **PCB Anomaly Detection**
   <!--hide_directive :sync: pcb-detect hide_directive-->

   ![Example of an instance ID for a pipeline](../_assets/pcb-instance-id.png "pcb anomaly detection instance id")

   <!--hide_directive
   :::
   ::::
   hide_directive-->

## Get Statistics of the Running Pipelines

Request the pipeline statistics with this cURL command.

Replace `HOST_IP` with the IP address of your system.

```bash
curl -k --location -X GET https://<HOST_IP>/api/pipelines/status
```

## Stop the Pipeline

Stop the pipeline with the following cURL command.

Replace `HOST_IP` with the IP address of your system and `instance_id` with the instance ID (without quotes) of the running pipeline.

```bash
curl -k --location -X DELETE https://<HOST_IP>/api/pipelines/{instance_id}
```

> **Note:**
> The instance ID is shown in the Terminal when the [pipeline was started](#start-the-pipeline) or when [pipeline statistics were requested](#get-statistics-of-the-running-pipelines).

## Additional Usage

### Batch Frames

You can process multiple streams together when batching is enabled and the same model instance (that is, the same model-instance-id) is used across pipeline instances.

To enable this, configure the pipeline’s inference element to support batching and assign a shared model instance ID. For example:

```sh
... ! gvadetect model=/path/to/model.xml model-instance-id=inst0 batch-size=4 ! ...
```

In this configuration, if 4 instances (or any multiple of 4) of the pipeline are launched (for example, using the curl commands described in the previous section), their frames will be grouped into batches of four and processed in a single inference call.

For more details about batching in DL Streamer, refer to the relevant section of the [Performance Guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/performance_guide.html#multi-stream-pipelines-with-single-ai-stage).
