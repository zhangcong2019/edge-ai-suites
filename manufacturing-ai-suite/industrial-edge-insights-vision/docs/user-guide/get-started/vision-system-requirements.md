See the list of certified edge AI systems as enabled through the  Intel® Edge System Qualification (Intel® ESQ) through the [catalog](https://builders.intel.com/ecosystem-engagement/solution-hub/edge-ai-catalog/partner-spotlight). On the left menu, you can filter by **Verticals > Manufacturing** or by **Intel Open Software Platform** > **Manufacturing AI Suite**.

> **Note:** Only a subset of sample applications are represented by the Intel® ESQ package. See [Test Suites](https://open-edge-platform.github.io/edge-system-qualification/main/getting-started/suites/) for more information.

> **Note:** You can also create apps tailored to your use case using models supported by DL Streamer.
> Check [the list of supported models](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/supported_models.html) for the latest information.
