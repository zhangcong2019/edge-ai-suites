**Win Vision AI** is a Python application for running multiple AI inference pipelines
concurrently on Intel hardware (CPU / GPU / NPU) on Windows. Built on GStreamer and Intel®
DL Streamer, it handles the end-to-end pipeline — from camera or video input,
through OpenVINO™-accelerated detection and classification, to live RTSP / WebRTC
streaming and structured metadata output.

Configuration is YAML-driven: define your models, input sources, and outputs, then
run. Advanced users can supply raw GStreamer pipeline strings directly for full
control.

> **Platform:** Windows 11

outputs, see [How It Works](./how-it-works.md).
