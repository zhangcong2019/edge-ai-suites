# View Open Telemetry Data

DL Streamer Pipeline Server supports gathering metrics over Open Telemetry. The supported metrics currently are:

- `cpu_usage_percentage`: Tracks CPU usage percentage of DL Streamer Pipeline Server Python process
- `memory_usage_bytes`: Tracks memory usage in bytes of DL Streamer Pipeline Server Python process
- `fps_per_pipeline`: Tracks FPS for each active pipeline instance in DL Streamer Pipeline Server

- Open `https://<HOST_IP>/prometheus` in your browser to view the prometheus console and try out the below queries:

   > **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of the application, ensure to provide `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` number in the URL for the app instance, i.e., replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`
   > If you are running a single instance and using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

  - `cpu_usage_percentage`
  - `memory_usage_bytes`
  - `fps_per_pipeline{}`

    - If you are starting multiple pipelines, then it can also be queried per pipeline ID. Example: `fps_per_pipeline{pipeline_id="658a5260f37d11ef94fc0242ac160005"}`

## End the demonstration

Follow this procedure to stop the sample application and end this demonstration.

1. Stop the sample application with the following command.

   > **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of the application, stop the services using `./run.sh down` instead.

   ```sh
   docker compose down -v
   ```

2. Confirm the containers are no longer running.

   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```
