# Use GPU For Inference in Vision AI Detection Apps

## Prerequisites

In order to benefit from hardware acceleration, pipelines can be constructed in a manner that different stages such as decoding, inference, etc., can make use of these devices.
For containerized applications built using the DL Streamer Pipeline Server, first we need to provide GPU device(s) access to the container user.

### Provide GPU access to the container

This can be done by making the following changes to the Docker Compose file.

```yaml
services:
  dlstreamer-pipeline-server:
    group_add:
      # render group ID for ubuntu 22.04 host OS
      - "110"
      # render group ID for ubuntu 24.04 host OS
      - "992"
    devices:
      # you can add specific devices in case you don't want to provide access to all like below.
      - "/dev:/dev"
```

The changes above adds the container user to the `render` group and provides access to the GPU devices.

### Hardware specific encoder/decoders

Unlike the changes done for the container above, the following requires a modification to the media pipeline itself.

GStreamer has a variety of hardware specific encoders and decoders elements such as Intel® specific VA-API elements that you can benefit from by adding them into your media pipeline. Examples of such elements are `vah264dec`, `vah264enc`, `vajpegdec`, etc.

Additionally, you can also enforce zero-copy of buffers using GStreamer caps (capabilities) to the pipeline by adding `video/x-raw(memory: VAMemory)` for Intel® GPUs (integrated and discrete).

Read DL Streamer [docs](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/gpu_device_selection.html) for more details.

### GPU specific element properties

DL Streamer inference elements also provides property such as `device=GPU` and `pre-process-backend=va-surface-sharing` to infer and pre-process on GPU. Read DL Streamer [docs](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/model_preparation.html#model-pre-and-post-processing) for more.

### Select the GPU render device of your choice if there is more than one GPU device on the system

If you have multiple GPUs (integrated/discrete), please follow [this](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/gpu_device_selection.html) DL Streamer document for selecting the GPU render device of your choice for VA codecs plugins.

## Tutorial on how to use GPU specific pipelines

> **Note:** The sample applications already provide a default `docker-compose.yml` file that includes the necessary GPU access to the containers.

<!--hide_directive ::::{tab-set} hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **Pallet Defect Detection**
<!--hide_directive :sync: pallet-detect hide_directive-->

The pipeline `pallet_defect_detection_gpu` contains GPU specific elements and uses GPU backend for inferencing. Start the pipeline as follows:

```sh
./sample_start.sh -p pallet_defect_detection_gpu
```

<!--hide_directive ::: hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **PCB Anomaly Detection**
<!--hide_directive :sync: pcb-detect hide_directive-->

The pipeline `pcb_anomaly_detection_gpu` contains GPU specific elements and uses GPU backend for inferencing. Start the pipeline as follows:

```sh
./sample_start.sh -p pcb_anomaly_detection_gpu
```

## Deployment with Helm

### Intel® GPU K8S Extension

If you are deploying a GPU based pipeline (example: with VA elements like `vapostproc`, `vah264dec`, etc., and/or with `device=GPU` in `gvadetect` in `dlstreamer_pipeline_server_config.json`) with Intel® GPU k8s Extension, ensure to set the below details in the file `helm/values.yaml` appropriately in order to utilize the underlying GPU.

```sh
gpu:
  enabled: true
  type: "gpu.intel.com/i915"
  count: 1
```

> **Note:** If your node uses Intel Xe discrete GPUs (Arc), set `gpu.type` to `"gpu.intel.com/xe"`.
