# Use NPU for Inference in Vision AI Detection Apps

## Prerequisites

To take full advantage of hardware acceleration, pipelines can be designed so that different stages—such as decoding and inference—are executed on the most suitable hardware devices.

Low-power accelerators like a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) can offload neural network computation from the CPU or GPU, enabling more efficient resource utilization and improved overall system performance.

DL Streamer and the DL Streamer Pipeline Server support inference on NPU devices, allowing applications built on these frameworks to leverage NPU acceleration for improved efficiency and performance.

Before running inference on an NPU, ensure that:

- The host system includes a supported NPU device
- The required NPU drivers are installed and properly configured

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/advanced_install/advanced_install_guide_prerequisites.html#optional-prerequisite-2-install-intel-npu-drivers).

 For containerized applications, the following additional changes are required.

### Provide NPU access to the container

This can be done by making the following changes to the Docker Compose file.

```yaml
services:
  dlstreamer-pipeline-server:
    group_add:
      # render group ID for ubuntu 22.04 host OS
      - "110"
      # render group ID for ubuntu 24.04 host OS
      - "992"
    devices:
      # you can add specific devices in case you don't want to provide access to all like below.
      - "/dev:/dev"
```

The changes above add the container user to the `render` group and provide access to the NPU devices.

### Hardware specific encoder/decoders

Unlike the changes done for the container above, the following requires a modification to the media pipeline itself.

GStreamer has a variety of hardware specific encoders and decoders elements such as Intel® specific VA-API elements that you can benefit from by adding them into your media pipeline. Examples of such elements are `vah264dec`, `vah264enc`, `vajpegdec`, etc.

Additionally, you can also enforce zero-copy of buffers using GStreamer caps (capabilities) to the pipeline by adding `video/x-raw(memory: VAMemory)` for Intel® NPUs.

Read DL Streamer [documentation on GPU device selection](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/gpu_device_selection.html) for more details.

### NPU specific element properties

DL Streamer inference elements also provides property such as `device=NPU` and `pre-process-backend=va` which should be used in pipelines with NPU memory. It performs mapping to the system memory and uses VA pre-processor. Read DL Streamer [documentation on model preparation](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/model_preparation.html#model-pre-and-post-processing) for more.

## Tutorial on how to use NPU specific pipelines

> **Note:** The sample applications already provide a default `docker-compose.yml` file that includes the necessary NPU access to the containers.

<!--hide_directive ::::{tab-set} hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **Pallet Defect Detection**
<!--hide_directive :sync: pallet-detect hide_directive-->

The pipeline `pallet_defect_detection_npu` in `pipeline-server-config.json` contains NPU specific elements and uses NPU backend for inferencing.

<!--hide_directive ::: hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **PCB Anomaly Detection**
<!--hide_directive :sync: pcb-detect hide_directive-->

The pipeline `pcb_anomaly_detection_npu` in `pipeline-server-config.json` contains NPU specific elements and uses NPU backend for inferencing.

<!--hide_directive
:::
::::
hide_directive-->

Follow the steps below to run the pipeline.

### Steps

1. Ensure that the sample application is up and running. If not, follow the steps [here](../get-started.md#set-up-the-application) to setup the application and then bring the services up

    > **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of the application, start the services using `./run.sh up` instead.

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

2. Start the pipeline.

  <!--hide_directive ::::{tab-set} hide_directive-->
  <!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **Pallet Defect Detection**
  <!--hide_directive :sync: pallet-detect hide_directive-->

    ```sh
    ./sample_start.sh -p pallet_defect_detection_npu
    ```

    This will start the pipeline. The inference stream can be viewed on WebRTC, in a browser, at the following URL:

    > **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of the application, ensure to provide `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` number in the URL for the app instance, i.e., replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`

    ```bash
    https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/pdd/
    ```

    <!--hide_directive ::: hide_directive-->
    <!--hide_directive :::{tab-item} hide_directive--> **PCB Anomaly Detection**
    <!--hide_directive :sync: pcb-detect hide_directive-->

     ```sh
     ./sample_start.sh -p pcb_anomaly_detection_npu
     ```

     This will start the pipeline. The inference stream can be viewed on WebRTC, in a browser, at the following URL:

     > **Note:** If you are running multiple instances of the application, ensure to provide `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` number in the URL for the app instance, i.e., replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`

     ```bash
     https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/anomaly/
     ```

    <!--hide_directive
    :::
    ::::
    hide_directive-->

## Deployment with Helm

### Intel® NPU K8S Extension

If you are deploying a NPU based pipeline (example: with VA elements like `vapostproc`, `vah264dec`, `vajpegdec`, etc., and/or with `device=NPU` in `gvadetect` in `dlstreamer_pipeline_server_config.json`) with Intel® NPU K8S Extension, ensure to set the below details in the file `helm/values.yaml` appropriately in order to utilize the underlying NPU.

```sh
npu:
  enabled: true
  type: "npu.intel.com/accel"
  count: 1
```
