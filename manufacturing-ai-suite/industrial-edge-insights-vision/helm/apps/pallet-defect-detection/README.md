# Deploy With Helm

## Prerequisites

- [System Requirements](../../../docs/user-guide/pallet-defect-detection/get-started/system-requirements.md)
- K8s installation on single or multi node must be done as prerequisite to continue the following deployment. Note: The Kubernetes cluster is set up with `kubeadm`, `kubectl` and `kubelet` packages on single and multi nodes with `v1.30.2`.
  Refer to tutorials online to setup Kubernetes cluster on the web with host OS as Ubuntu 22.04 and/or Ubuntu 24.04.
- For Helm installation, refer to [Helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Setup the application

> **Note:** The following instructions assume Kubernetes is already running in the host system with Helm package manager installed.

1. Clone the **edge-ai-suites** repository and change into industrial-edge-insights-vision directory. The directory contains the utility scripts required in the instructions that follows.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.2.0
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/
   ```

2. Set app specific `values.yaml` file.

   ```sh
   cp helm/values_pallet-defect-detection.yaml helm/values.yaml
   ```

3. Edit the HOST_IP, proxy and other environment variables in `helm/values.yaml` as follows:

   ```yaml
   env:
       HOST_IP: <HOST_IP>   # host IP address
       MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: <DATABASE USERNAME> #  example: minioadmin
       MINIO_SECRET_KEY: <DATABASE PASSWORD> #  example: minioadmin
       http_proxy: <http proxy> # proxy details if behind proxy
       https_proxy: <https proxy>
       SAMPLE_APP: pallet-defect-detection # application directory
   webrtcturnserver:
       username: <username>  # WebRTC credentials e.g. intel1234
       password: <password>
   ```

4. Install prerequisites. Run with sudo if needed.

   ```sh
   ./setup.sh helm
   ```

   This sets up application prerequisites, downloads artifacts, sets executable permissions for scripts, etc. Downloaded resource directories.

## Deploy the application

1. Install the Helm chart

   ```sh
   helm install app-deploy helm -n apps --create-namespace
   ```

   After installation, check the status of the running pods:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n apps
   ```

   To view logs of a specific pod, replace `<pod_name>` with the actual pod name from the output above:

   ```sh
   kubectl logs -n apps -f <pod_name>
   ```

2. Copy the resources such as video and model from local directory to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make them available for application while launching pipelines.

   ```sh
   # Below is an example for Pallet Defect Detection. Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n apps -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/videos/warehouse.avi $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/models/* $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps
   ```

3. Fetch the list of pipeline loaded available to launch

   ```sh
   ./sample_list.sh helm
   ```

   This lists the pipeline loaded in DL Streamer Pipeline Server.

   Output:

   ```text
   # Example output for Pallet Defect Detection
   Environment variables loaded from /home/intel/OEP/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
   Running sample app: pallet-defect-detection
   Checking status of dlstreamer-pipeline-server...
   Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200
   Loaded pipelines:
   [
       ...
       {
           "description": "DL Streamer Pipeline Server pipeline",
           "name": "user_defined_pipelines",
           "parameters": {
           "properties": {
               "detection-properties": {
               "element": {
                   "format": "element-properties",
                   "name": "detection"
               }
               }
           },
           "type": "object"
           },
           "type": "GStreamer",
           "version": "pallet_defect_detection"
       }
       ...
   ]
   ```

4. Start the sample application with a pipeline.

   ```sh
   ./sample_start.sh helm -p pallet_defect_detection
   ```

   This command looks for the payload for the pipeline specified in `-p` argument above, inside the `payload.json` file and launches a pipeline instance in DL Streamer Pipeline Server. Refer to the table to learn about different options available.

   Output:

   ```sh
   # Example output for Pallet Defect Detection
   Environment variables loaded from /home/intel/OEP/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
   Running sample app: pallet-defect-detection
   Checking status of dlstreamer-pipeline-server...
   Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200
   Loading payload from /home/intel/OEP/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/helm/apps/pallet-defect-detection/payload.json
   Payload loaded successfully.

   ```

   > **Note:** This starts the pipeline. You can view the inference stream on WebRTC by opening a browser and navigating to `https://<HOST_IP>:30443/mediamtx/pdd/` for Pallet Defect Detection.

5. Get status of pipeline instance(s) running.

   ```sh
   ./sample_status.sh helm
   ```

   This command lists the status of pipeline instances launched during the lifetime of the sample application.

   Output:

   ```text
   # Example output for Pallet Defect Detection
   Environment variables loaded from /home/intel/OEP/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
   Running sample app: pallet-defect-detection
   [
   {
       "avg_fps": 30.00446179356829,
       "elapsed_time": 36.927825689315796,
       "id": "99ac50d852b511f09f7c2242868ff651",
       "message": "",
       "start_time": 1750956469.620569,
       "state": "RUNNING"
   }
   ]
   ```

6. Stop pipeline instance.

   ```sh
   ./sample_stop.sh helm
   ```

   This command will stop all instances that are currently in `RUNNING` state and respond with the last status.

    Output:

   ```text
   # Example output for Pallet Defect Detection
   No pipelines specified. Stopping all pipeline instances
   Environment variables loaded from /home/intel/OEP/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
   Running sample app: pallet-defect-detection
   Checking status of dlstreamer-pipeline-server...
   Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200
   Instance list fetched successfully. HTTP Status Code: 200
   Found 1 running pipeline instances.
   Stopping pipeline instance with ID: 99ac50d852b511f09f7c2242868ff651
   Pipeline instance with ID '99ac50d852b511f09f7c2242868ff651' stopped successfully. Response: {
   "avg_fps": 30.01631239459745,
   "elapsed_time": 49.30651903152466,
   "id": "99ac50d852b511f09f7c2242868ff651",
   "message": "",
   "start_time": 1750960037.1471195,
   "state": "RUNNING"
   }
   ```

   If you wish to stop a specific instance, you can provide it with an `--id` argument to the command.
   For example, `./sample_stop.sh helm --id 99ac50d852b511f09f7c2242868ff651`

7. Uninstall the helm chart.

   ```sh
   helm uninstall app-deploy -n apps
   ```
