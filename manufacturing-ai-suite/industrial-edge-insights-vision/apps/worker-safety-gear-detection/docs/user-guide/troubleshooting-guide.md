## Resolving Time Sync Issues in Prometheus

If you see the following warning in Prometheus, it indicates a time sync issue.

**Warning: Error fetching server time: Detected xxx.xxx seconds time difference between your browser and the server.**

You can following the below steps to synchronize system time using NTP.
1. **Install systemd-timesyncd** if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install systemd-timesyncd
   ```

2. **Check service status**:
   ```bash
   systemctl status systemd-timesyncd
   ```

3. **Configure an NTP server** (if behind a corporate proxy):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
   ```
   Add:
   ```ini
   [Time]
   NTP=corp.intel.com
   ```
   Replace `corp.intel.com` with a different ntp server that is supported on your network.

4. **Restart the service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
   ```

5. **Verify the status**:
   ```bash
   systemctl status systemd-timesyncd
   ```

This should resolve the time discrepancy in Prometheus.
