# Overview and Architecture

This Sample Application enables real-time safety gear monitoring of workers by running inference workflows across multiple AI models. It connects multiple video streams from different construction sites cameras to AI-powered pipelines, all operating efficiently on a single industrial PC. This solution enhances logistics efficiency and inventory management by detecting defects before they impact operations.
