# How To Manage Pipeline

This section describes how to create custom AI pipelines for the sample application and the commands to manage these pipelines.

## Create Pipelines

The AI pipelines are defined by the **pipeline-server-config.json** file present under the configs subdirectory of a particular application directory (for docker compose deployment) and similary inside the helm directory (for helm based deployment. Please also note that the port in the cURL/REST requests needs to be changed from 8080 to 30107 for helm based deployment).

The following is an example of the PCB anomaly detection pipeline, which is included in the **pipeline-server-config.json** file.
```sh
    "pipelines": [
    {
        "name": "pcb_anomaly_detection",
        "source": "gstreamer",
        "queue_maxsize": 50,
        "pipeline": "{auto_source} name=source ! decodebin ! gvaclassify name=classification inference-region=full-frame device=CPU pre-process-backend=opencv model-instance-id=inst0 ! queue ! gvawatermark ! gvafpscounter ! appsink name=destination",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "classification-properties": {
                    "element": {
                        "name": "classification",
                        "format": "element-properties"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "auto_start": false,
        "publish_frame": true
    },
```

Customize the pipeline according to your needs. For details, see the following DL Streamer Pipeline Server documentation:
- [Launch configurable pipelines](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/main/user-guide/how-to-launch-configurable-pipelines.html)
- [Autostart pipelines](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/main/user-guide/how-to-autostart-pipelines.html)

## Start the Pipeline

Follow this procedure to start the pipeline.

1. In the **pipeline-server-config.json** file, identify the name of the pipeline you want to start.

   The name of the pipeline is defined by the **name** parameter.

        "pipelines": [
            {
                  "name": "pipeline_name",
                  "source": "....",
                  "pipeline": "...."
                  "..."
            }
         ]

2. You use a Client URL (cURL) command to start the pipeline.

      In this example, a pipeline included in this sample application is **pcb_anomaly_detection**. Start this pipeline with the following cURL command.

            curl http://<HOST_IP>:8080/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pcb_anomaly_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
                "source": {
                    "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/anomalib_pcb_test.avi",
                    "type": "uri"
                },
                "parameters": {
                    "detection-properties": {
                        "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/pcb-anomaly-detection/deployment/Anomaly classification/model/model.xml",
                        "device": "CPU"
                    }
                }
            }'


2. Take note of the instance ID (without quotes).

   Each pipeline has its **instance ID**. You will need the instance ID to stop the pipeline later.

## Get Statistics of the Running Pipelines

Request the pipeline statistics with this cURL command.

Replace **HOST_IP** with the IP address of your system.

         curl --location -X GET http://<HOST_IP>:8080/pipelines/status

## Stop the Pipeline

Stop the pipeline with the following cURL command.

Replace **HOST_IP** with the IP address of your system and **instance_id** with the instance ID (without quotes) of the running pipeline.

         curl --location -X DELETE http://<HOST_IP>:8080/pipelines/{instance_id}

> **Note**
> The instance ID is shown in the Terminal when the [pipeline was started](#start-the-pipeline) or when [pipeline statistics were requested](#get-statistics-of-the-running-pipelines).
