## MQTT Publisher Simulator

The MQTT publisher simulator extracts weld/wind turbine data from a CSV file(s) and sends it as a JSON-formatted data over the configured topic to the MQTT broker. The Telegraf MQTT input plugin then subscribes to this topic to receive the weld/wind turbine data.

The MQTT publisher simulator is used for ingesting the weld data and wind turbine data in the `Weld Defect Detection Sample App` and `Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection Sample App` respectively.

## OPC-UA Server Simulator

The OPC-UA server simulator acts as a dummy OPC-UA server creating the nodes for the wind turbine data by reading from the CSV file and writing the data to the OPC-UA input plugin in Telegraf. The OPC-UA server simulator if configured in Time Series Analytics microservice can act as data destination for receiving the anomaly alerts.

The OPC-UA server simulator is used for ingesting the wind turbine data in the `Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection Sample App`.
