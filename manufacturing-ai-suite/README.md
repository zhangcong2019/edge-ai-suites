# Manufacturing AI Suite

Manufacturing AI Suite is a curated and open set of software solutions intended to demonstrate
the applicability and efficiency of Intel hardware in industry-specific edge AI use cases.

The suite simplifies building, deploying, and scaling custom real time edge AI solutions for
industrial environments by providing AI acceleration tools, support for IoT protocols (MQTT/OPC UA),
accelerated analytics libraries, multi camera system software, and reusable sample applications,
frameworks, microservices, and benchmarks.

It includes:

- Tools for AI acceleration (for example, MQTT/OPC UA support, analytics libraries, camera system software)
- A complete AI pipeline for closed-loop systems
- Benchmarking support for evaluating performance across time series, vision, and generative AI workloads

**Manufacturing AI Suite** helps you develop solutions for:

- **Production Workflow**: Detect defects, optimize efficiency
- **Safety**: AI-driven risk reduction
- **Real-Time Insights**: Local data processing, trend tracking
- **Automation**: Instant alerts and corrective actions
