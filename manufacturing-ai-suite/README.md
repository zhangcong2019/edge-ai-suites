The Manufacturing AI Suite empowers smart factories with responsive, scalable edge AI. With an open ecosystem, seamless integration with new and existing systems, and strong data privacy controls, it accelerates AI deployment on the factory floor. Optimized for Intel, it delivers real-time insights, enabling more efficient operations and an agile factory. 

The Manufacturing AI Suite helps you develop solutions for:
- Production Workflow: Efficiency optimizations, product quality (detect anomalies, defects, or variations)
- Workplace Safety: AI-based safety insights to help reduce risks
- Real-Time Insights: Improve the production process (local data processing, integration with existing manufacturing executions systems, tracking defect rates, identifying trends)
- Automation: Correct problems almost immediately (instant alerts, implementation of corrective actions)

Please see sample applications such as [Pallet Defect Detection](pallet-defect-detection), [Weld Porosity](weld-porosity) to learn utilizing these workflows to accelerate your solution development for AI in manufacturing use cases.
