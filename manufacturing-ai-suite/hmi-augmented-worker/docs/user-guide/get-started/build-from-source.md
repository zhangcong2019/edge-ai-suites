## Build File Watcher Service from Source

In the Windows® environment, the File Watcher Service works with the HMI application to continuously monitor file system activities such as creation, modification, and deletion. When it detects any changes, it sends the relevant file data over the network to the `Chat Q&A Core` service for ingestion and contextual processing, supporting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.

### Prerequisites

- **Python Installer**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Select the latest version available under the "Python Releases for Windows" section.

- **Git \[OPTIONAL]**: Visit the [official GIT website](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to download the executable

### Build File Watcher Service in Windows

To build the File Watcher executable binary, follow these steps:

1. Go to the target directory of your choice and clone the suite.
If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `main` with the desired tag.
To learn more on partial cloning, check the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

   ```bash
   git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch release-2026.2.0 https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
   cd edge-ai-suites
   git sparse-checkout set manufacturing-ai-suite
   ```

2. Set up the Virtual Environment with Python venv.

   - Open Command Prompt.

        - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.

   - Create Virtual Environment.

     ```sh
     # Replace `<venv_name>` with your preferred name.
     python -m venv <venv_name>
     ```

3. Activate the Virtual Environment.

   ```sh
   <venv_name>\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Once it's activated, the environment name appears in parentheses as follows:

   ```text
   (venv_name) C:\Users\YourName\project>
   ```

4. Navigate to the Project folder downloaded in Step 1.

   ```sh
   cd edge-ai-suites\manufacturing-ai-suite\hmi-augmented-worker\file_watcher
   ```

5. Install Packages Inside the Virtual Environment.

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
   ```

   If your system is behind a proxy, do as follows:

   ```sh
   # Replace <your_proxy> and <port> to your network proxy and port number
   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir --proxy <your_proxy>:<port>
   ```

   On Windows®, typically, proxy information can be fetched using the command,

   ```sh
   netsh winhttp show proxy
   ```

   This will output one of the following two outputs:

   ```text
   Current WinHTTP proxy settings:
        Direct access (no proxy server).
   ```

   or

   ```text
   Current WinHTTP proxy settings:
        Proxy Server:  <your_proxy>:<port>
        Bypass List:   <bypass_list>
   ```

6. Set up Environment Variables using `.bat`.

   To configure the file watcher service, you need to set up the environment variables using the [`set_env_vars.bat`](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/release-2026.2.0/manufacturing-ai-suite/hmi-augmented-worker/file_watcher/set_env_vars.bat) file provided. Follow the steps below to ensure proper configuration:

   - Open and edit the values for the variables with your corresponding setup.

     Open the `set_env_vars.bat` file and update the values for the environment variables according to your setup. Below are the detailed explanation:

     - **WATCH_DIRECTORY**:

       This should point to the directory you want the file watcher service to monitor. It should be a valid path on your system where files are expected to be added, monitored, or deleted. The service will track these events and send the file data to the backend for embedding creation.

       **Important**: Ensure that the directory specified in `WATCH_DIRECTORY` does not have access or permission restrictions. The file watcher service must have read and write permissions to monitor and process files within this directory effectively. And also only `.txt`, `.pdf` and `.docx` file format are only supported formats by backend for embedding creation.

       Examples of Valid Directory Paths:

       - On Windows:

         - C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\WatchedFolder
         - D:\Data\Projects\MonitorFolder

     - **DOCUMENT_ENDPOINT**:

       This variable should be set to the URL of your backend service where the file data will be sent. Replace <your-backend-service-ip> with the actual IP address or hostname of your backend service.

     - **no_proxy**:

       This variable is used to specify IP addresses or hostnames that should bypass the proxy settings if your system is behind proxy. Set this to the IP address of your backend service to ensure direct communication.

   - Then, execute the `.bat` file as shown:

     ```sh
     .\set_env_vars.bat
     ```

   - After executing the `set_env_vars.bat` file, you should see no output if the scripts run successfully. The environment variables will be set in the current command prompt session, and you can verify them by running the following command:

     ```sh
     echo %WATCH_DIRECTORY%
     echo %DOCUMENT_ENDPOINT%
     echo %no_proxy%
     ```

     These commands will display the values you have set for each variable, confirming that they are correctly configured.

7. Compile and build the File Watcher Service executable.

   ```sh
   pyinstaller file_watcher.py -F --onefile
   ```

8. Execute the File Watcher Service executable.

   - Before starting the File Watcher Service, ensure that your backend `Chat Q&A Core` service is up.

     ```sh
     .\dist\file_watcher.exe
     ```

9. After the service starts, the file watcher continuously monitors file events occurring in the designated folder specified by `WATCH_DIRECTORY` in the `set_env_vars.bat` file, until it is stopped by a keyboard interrupt.

## Troubleshooting

### `Error: [WinError 206] The filename or extension is too long`

#### Description:

When attempting to install packages using `pip` on Windows, you may encounter the following error:

```sh
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [WinError 206] The filename or extension is too long: "...
```

#### Solution:

- Modify the registry entry using Registry Editor.

  1. Open Registry Editor:

     - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
     - Type `regedit` and press Enter.

  2. Navigate to the FileSystem Key:

     - Go to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem`

  3. Modify LongPathsEnabled:

     - Find the `LongPathsEnabled` entry.
     - Double-click on it and set its value to `1`.
     - Click OK to save the changes.

After enabling long path support, you may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Once done, try running your `pip install` command again.

If the issue persists, consider using a shorter path for your project or virtual environment, as mentioned earlier. Moving your project to a directory with a shorter path can help avoid hitting the path length limit.
