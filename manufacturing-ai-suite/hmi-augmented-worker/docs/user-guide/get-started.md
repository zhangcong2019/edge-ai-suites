# Get Started

The `Get Started` guide explains how the HMI Augmented Worker application can be setup on a
Type-2 hypervisor with the HMI on a Windows® VM while deploying the RAG pipeline natively on
the Hypervisor host (Edge Microvisor Toolkit).

## Prerequisites

The sample application has mandatory prerequisites that are covered in other documentation.
The user is required to refer to the respective documentation for the details. The prerequisites
listed below cover such dependencies.

- Set up Edge Microvisor Toolkit based Type-2 Hypervisor host on target hardware. Edge
Microvisor Toolkit is a reference hypervisor which has been used for validation. Other Type-2
hypervisors can also be used as per user preference. Reference documentation link for
Edge Microvisor Toolkit as a VM host is provided in [Other Documentation](#other-documentation)
section. The reader is advised to contact Intel representatives for further details on
configuring an Edge Microvisor Toolkit host VM and instructions on hosting the Windows® Guest OS.

- The `HMI Augmented Worker` sample application utilizes `Chat Question & Answer Core` for
the RAG pipeline. The [documentation](#other-documentation) available with
`Chat Question & Answer Core` covers the details of how to set up the RAG pipeline, deploy
it, and consume the application. Follow the instructions provided and set up the RAG pipeline.

- Supported target hardware details are available in the [system requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md) page.

## Application Configuration

This section covers the details of the configuration of each constituent blocks of the application.

### Chat Question & Answer Core (Chat Q&A Core)

The RAG capability provided by the `Chat Q&A Core` is set up in the Host partition following
instructions as updated in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). The following knobs are available
for configuration of the `Chat Q&A Core` application.

1. **Number of CPUs allocation**: Allocation of cores to the VM (or host) running the
`Chat Q&A Core` is configurable in combination with the core requirements for the Windows® VM.
In the current version, the Core allocation is done to the Windows® Guest VM which in turn
determines the available cores for the Host partition. Together with the model selection, the
core selection forms a tradeoff of performance vs. accuracy, which need to be accounted for.
Just like the CPU, it is also possible to share the GPU (iGPU or dGPU) between the Windows® VM
and applications running on host through SRIOV. However, the performance vs. accuracy tradeoff
analysis, along with recommended configurations has not been done and validated in the current
version of the sample application.

2. **Deployment Option**: It is possible to deploy the `Chat Q&A Core` both using Helm or with
Docker Compose. The former will need Kubevirt based infrastructure which can manage both the
VM(s) and the containers. The recommendation is to use the Docker Compose based deployment.

3. **Model configuration**: The model used, especially its parameter count, determines not only
the accuracy, but also the required compute. As explained in (1), this forms a
performance-accuracy tradeoff, which needs to be factored in when selecting the model. The
model here maps to the requirement of the entire RAG pipeline, viz. LLM, Embedding, Retriever,
and Reranker.

### File Watcher Service

The File Watcher service will need to be built and deployed. There is no pre-built option
provided currently. It runs in the Windows® VM and is responsible for watching the configured
folder for new contents. The new contents are added to the RAG context database which is then
used by the RAG pipeline when responding to user queries. Refer to
[Build File Watcher Service from Source](./get-started/build-from-source.md#build-file-watcher-service-from-source) to compile the file watcher service executable
binary from source.

In addition to the File Watcher service, the WebUI interface to access the RAG functionality
is also run on the Windows® VM. This is explained in the [how to use the application](#how-to-use-the-application) section.

## How to use the application?

To use the application effectively, make sure that all the steps mentioned in the above [section](#application-configuration):

- Deploy the `Chat Q&A Core` on the Host partition.

  Deploy the `Chat Q&A Core` using either of the following methods:

  - **Docker Compose deployment** (recommended for simpler setups): Use this for local or
  non-Kubernetes environments.

  - **Helm-based deployment** (recommended for Kubernetes environments with KubeVirt support):
  This method allows you to manage both VMs and containers in a unified infrastructure but
  with more complicated framework setup.

  Ensure that the deployment configuration aligns with your desired CPU/GPU allocation and
  model selection, as these impact performance and accuracy.

- Build and Run the File Watcher Service

  The File Watcher service must be compiled from source and deployed on the Windows® VM. It
  monitors a configured folder for new files and updates the RAG context database accordingly.
  Refer to [Build File Watcher Service from Source](./get-started/build-from-source.md) for build
  instructions. Start the service on the Windows® VM after deployment.

- Access the WebUI

  While the WebUI component can be independently developed by third-party users to suit
  specific use cases, this sample application reuses the WebUI bundled with the `Chat Q&A Core`
  for demonstration purposes. The WebUI runs on the same Windows® VM and provides a simple
  interface to interact with the RAG pipeline.
  Open a browser and navigate to the WebUI endpoint (e.g., `http://<hostvm-ip>:<port-num>`).
  The `port-num` is the same as provided in the `Chat Q&A Core` documentation.

- Interact with the RAG Pipeline once the entire setup is running:

  - Upload or place documents in the watched folder.
  - Wait for the File Watcher to process and update the context.
  - Submit questions via the WebUI.
  - Receive context-aware answers powered by the configured LLM, embedding model, retriever,
  and reranker.
