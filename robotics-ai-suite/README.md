# Robotics AI Suite

The **Robotics AI Suite** is a preview collection of robotics applications, libraries, samples, and benchmarking tools to help you build solutions faster. It includes models and pipelines optimized with the OpenVINO™ toolkit for accelerated performance on Intel® CPUs, integrated GPUs, and NPUs. Refer to the [detailed user guide and documentation](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/ai-suite-robotics.html).

The **Robotics AI Suite** is organized into **collections** that group workflows and capabilities for different robot categories. Each collection provides:

- Libraries for core robotics workloads and control recipes.
- Integration with ROS 2, supported sensor profiles, and benchmarking tools.
- OpenVINO™-optimised models for computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and vision-language-action (VLA).
- Hardware acceleration on Intel® CPUs, integrated GPUs, and NPUs for faster inference.

The types of collection are as follows:

- **Humanoid Imitation Learning**
  For robots that learn and replicate human actions to perform interactive or assistive tasks.
- **Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)**
  For robots that navigate and operate independently in dynamic environments such as warehouses or factories.
- **Stationary Robot Vision & Control**
  For fixed-position robots using vision systems for tasks like inspection, assembly, or quality control.

## Architecture

The diagram below is the single, consolidated view of the Robotics AI Suite. It shows the major software components, how perception, navigation, manipulation, Physical AI, and benchmarking relate, which parts are Intel-provided versus upstream open source, and how workloads map onto Intel® heterogeneous compute (CPU / iGPU / NPU). You should be able to understand what the suite includes — and where Intel adds value — without reading further.

**How to read it**

- Colour tells you ownership: **Intel-provided / optimized** (blue), **ROS 2 / upstream open source** (green), **Intel® silicon** (dark blue), and **user-supplied** robot, sensors, and datasets (grey). A **★** marks Intel value-add over the upstream component.
- The stack is layered top-to-bottom: **developer experience & tooling**, **AI models & pipelines** (OpenVINO™-optimized), **robotics middleware & frameworks** on **ROS 2**, **system software** (real-time kernel, drivers, EtherCAT), and the **Intel® Core™ / Core™ Ultra** hardware. Everything above the hardware line is what you consolidate onto a single Intel platform.

**What you get, and how it fits together**

- **Perception, navigation, and manipulation** are ROS 2 stacks. Intel adds optimized components on top of upstream Nav2, MoveIt, and ORB-SLAM3 — ITS-Planner, FastMapping, Collaborative SLAM, ADBScan, and GroundFloor Segmentation for AMRs; Robot Vision & Control (RVC) and Visual Servoing (CNS) for stationary arms.
- **Physical AI / Embodied models** — VLA (Pi0.5+RTC, RDT-1B), ACT, and Diffusion Policy / iDP3 — plus **LLM / VLM task planning** run through the OpenVINO™ runtime and oneAPI.
- **Benchmarking & tooling** — ROS 2 KPI monitoring, Gazebo simulation, sample applications, and model-optimization / setup tooling — sit in the top developer-experience layer.

**Where Intel accelerates the workload**

Perception and detection run on the **NPU / iGPU**; VLA / diffusion policies and LLM / VLM planning on the **iGPU** (optionally a discrete **Arc™ GPU**); deterministic motion control and planning on the **CPU** with a `PREEMPT_RT` kernel and EtherCAT. OpenVINO™ selects the device per workload, so perception, AI, planning, and real-time control are consolidated on one Intel® platform.

### Runtime data flow

Sensor data flows through perception into the AI decision models, then to planning and real-time control, and out to the actuators — with feedback closing the loop. Each stage is annotated with the compute it targets.

### Workloads mapped to Intel hardware

Each collection uses Intel heterogeneous compute differently. The matrix summarizes the primary (●) and optional (○) compute target for each collection.
