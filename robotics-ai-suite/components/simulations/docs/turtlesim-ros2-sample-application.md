- Launch rqt graphic application so that the turtle can be controlled.
- Launch rviz graphic application to view ROS topics.

## Prerequisites

- [Prepare the target system](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html)
- [Setup the Robotics AI Dev Kit APT Repositories](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#set-up-the-autonomous-mobile-robot-apt-repositories)
- [Install OpenVINO™ Packages](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#install-openvino-packages)
- [Install Robotics AI Dev Kit Deb packages](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#install-autonomous-mobile-robot-deb-packages)
- [Install the Intel® NPU Driver on Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors (if applicable)](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#install-the-intel-npu-driver-on-intel-core-ultra-processors)

## Run the Turtlesim ROS 2 Sample application

1. To download and install the Turtlesim ROS 2 sample application run
    the command below:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ros-humble-turtlesim-tutorial-demo
    ```

2. Set up your ROS 2 environment

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    ```

3. Run the Turtlesim ROS 2 sample application:

    ```bash
    ros2 launch turtlesim_tutorial turtlesim_tutorial.launch.py
    ```

4. In the rqt application, navigate to **Plugins** \> **Services** \>
    **Service Caller**. To move \'turtle1\', choose
    /turtle1/teleport_absolute from the service dropdown list. Ensure to
    update the x and y values from their original settings. Press the
