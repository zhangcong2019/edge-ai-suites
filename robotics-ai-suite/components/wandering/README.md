# Wandering - The Wandering Mobile Robot Application

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation on this component is available here: [dev guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/dev_guide/tutorials_amr/navigation/wandering_app/index.html).

## Overview

The Wandering mobile robot application is a Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) sample application that moves the robot around the room avoiding hitting obstacles, updating a map in real time that is exposed as the ROS topic.

The application consists of two ROS nodes, developed by Intel. In order to function properly, those two nodes depend on other ROS nodes/packages: RealSense ROS wrapper, Nav2 ROS package, RTABMAP with its ROS Wrapper and robot drivers.

This is represented on the diagram below:

In the diagram above, kobuki robot was used, and its kobuki ROS node is used for issuing movement commands coming from Nav2 ROS node.

## Get Started

### System Requirements

Prepare the target system following the [official documentation](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html).

### Build

To build debian packages, export `ROS_DISTRO` env variable to desired platform and run `make package` command. After build process successfully finishes, built packages will be available in the root directory. The following command is an example for `Jazzy` distribution.

```bash
ROS_DISTRO=jazzy make package
```

You can list all built packages:

```bash
ls|grep -i .deb
```

```text
ros-jazzy-wandering_2.3-1_amd64.deb
ros-jazzy-wandering-aaeon-tutorial_2.3-1_amd64.deb
ros-jazzy-wandering-irobot-tutorial_2.3-1_amd64.deb
ros-jazzy-wandering-jackal-tutorial_2.3-1_amd64.deb
ros-jazzy-wandering-gazebo-tutorial_2.3-1_amd64.deb
ros-jazzy-wandering-tutorials_2.3-1_amd64.deb
```

`*build-deps*.deb` package is generated during build process and installation of such packages could be skipped on target platform.

To clean up all build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

### Install

If Ubuntu 22.04 with Humble is used, then run

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

If Ubuntu 24.04 with Jazzy is used, then run

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

Finally, install the Debian package that was built via ``make package``:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./ros-$(ROS_DISTRO)-wandering_*_amd64.deb
```

## ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic Compatibility

### Twist vs TwistStamped

ROS 2 Jazzy with Gazebo Harmonic requires `geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped` for robot motion, while Humble with Gazebo Classic uses `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`. This difference is automatically handled:

**Simulation (Gazebo)**:
- **Humble + Gazebo Classic**: Uses `Twist` (default)
- **Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic**: Uses `TwistStamped` via `enable_stamped_cmd_vel: true` parameter
- Launch files automatically select the correct configuration based on `ROS_DISTRO` environment variable

**Real Hardware**:
- Uses `Twist` on both Humble and Jazzy (hardware drivers unchanged)
- No configuration changes needed when upgrading from Humble to Jazzy
- Applies to: AAEON, iRobot Create3, Clearpath Jackal, and similar platforms

To verify what your system expects:
```bash
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel -v
```

### LiDAR Visualization

Gazebo Harmonic does not render LiDAR rays in the 3D view like Gazebo Classic. Use RViz2 for LiDAR visualization:
```bash
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
# Add → LaserScan display → Topic: /scan
```

The LiDAR sensor data publishes correctly and works with Nav2 navigation.

### Test

To run unit tests (implemented with ``colcon``) execute the below command with target ``ROS_DISTRO`` (example for Jazzy):

```bash
ROS_DISTRO=jazzy make test
```

To run E2E functional tests that validate Wandering in a practical setup, execute:

```bash
ROS_DISTRO=jazzy make test-e2e
```

### Development

There is a set of prepared Makefile targets to speed up the development.

In particular, use the following Makefile target to run code linters.

```bash
make lint
```

Alternatively, you can run linters individually.

```bash
make lint-bash
make lint-clang
make lint-githubactions
make lint-json
make lint-markdown
make lint-python
make lint-yaml
```

To run license compliance validation:

```bash
make license-check
```

To see a full list of available Makefile targets:

```bash
make help
```                                                              

```text         
Target               Description
------               -----------
license-check        Perform a REUSE license check using docker container https://hub.docker.com/r/fsfe/reuse
lint                 Run all sub-linters using super-linter (using linters defined for this repo only)
lint-all             Run super-linter over entire repository (auto-detects code to lint)
lint-bash            Run Bash linter using super-linter
lint-clang           Run clang linter using super-linter
lint-githubactions   Run Github Actions linter using super-linter

```

## Usage

### Tutorials

This repository provides several tutorials showing the Wandering App running on robotic kits:

- [Wandering Application in a Waffle Gazebo Simulation](./docs/launch-wandering-application-gazebo-sim-waffle.md)
- [Wandering Application on AAEON robot with Intel® RealSense™ Camera and RTAB-Map SLAM](./docs/wandering-aaeon-tutorial.md)
- [Execute the Wandering Application on the Jackal™ Robot](./docs/jackal-wandering.md)

### Visualization

In the `rviz` folder, the Rviz2 config file can be found with Wandering app relevant ROS topics.

```bash
rviz2 -d rviz/config.rviz
```

## Agent Workflow

The Wandering Sample has a dedicated VS Code Copilot skill that enforces a review-first workflow before any edits are applied.

**Direct invocation** — mention the skill by name in the chat to activate it explicitly:

```
@wandering-sample <describe your change and target mode: simulation, real robot, or both>
```

**Auto-detection** — VS Code will automatically apply this skill when your request mentions keywords matched by the skill description (e.g., Wandering launch files, Nav2 wiring, RTAB-Map, RealSense, robot bring-up paths, or editing files under `components/wandering`). No explicit mention is required in those cases.

The skill enforces:
1. Repository review before any edit.
2. A proposed plan and diff shown for approval before changes are applied.
3. Changes scoped to the Wandering Sample unless you ask otherwise.

The full skill definition, including the expected ASCII pipeline diagram and simulation/real-robot guidance, lives at [`.github/skills/wandering-sample/SKILL.md`](.github/skills/wandering-sample/SKILL.md).
