# Multi-Camera Demo (RealSense D457 AI Demo)

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation on this component is available here: [dev guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/dev_guide/tutorials_amr/perception/openvino/pyrealsense2_d457_multicam_object_detection_tutorial.html).

## Overview

In this demo four instances of AI applications for object detection are run in parallel using four RealSense™ camera streams. The Ultralytics YOLOv8 model and mobilenet-ssd model are downloaded and used for object detection and segmentation.

The multicamera usecase is demonstrated using an Axiomtek Robox500 Industrial PC and 4x Intel® RealSense™ GMSL/FAKRA Stereo Camera D457. The Axiomtek Robox500 industrial PC consists of an 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1270PE, 28W Alderlake P Processor and an Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics iGPU. However, this demo can be run on any Intel® platform which has a GPU and also with 4x USB Intel® RealSense™ cameras.

The setup looks like as described in the table below.

## Get Started

### System Requirements

Prepare the target system following the [official documentation](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html).

### Build

To build debian packages, export `ROS_DISTRO` env variable to desired platform and run `make package` command. After build process successfully finishes, built packages will be available in the root directory. The following command is an example for `Humble` distribution.

```bash
ROS_DISTRO=humble make package
```

You can list all built packages:

```bash
ls|grep -i .deb
```

```text
ros-humble-pyrealsense2-ai-demo_*_amd64.deb
ros-humble-pyrealsense2-ai-demo-build-deps_*_amd64.deb
```

`*build-deps*.deb` package is generated during build process and installation of such packages could be skipped on target platform.

To build Docker image:

```bash
make image
```

To clean all build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

### Install

If Ubuntu 22.04 with Humble is used, then run

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

If Ubuntu 24.04 with Jazzy is used, then run

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

Finally, install the Debian package that was built via `make package`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-pyrealsense2-ai-demo_*_amd64.deb
```

**Note:**

The ros-humble-pyrealsense2-ai-demo installation will also do the following:

* Installs all the python dependency packages needed for the demo to run.
* Downloads the YOLOv8 model files from Ultralytics and generate the models.
* Download and build the mobilenet-ssd model using the omz_downloader.

The installation will run for 25-30 minutes and consumes approx 2GB of the disk space.

### Test

To run unit tests execute the below command:

```bash
make test
```

### Development

There is a set of prepared Makefile targets to speed up the development.

In particular, use the following Makefile target to run code linters.

```bash
make lint
```

Alternatively, you can run linters individually.

```bash
make lint-bash
make lint-githubactions
make lint-json
make lint-markdown
make lint-python
make lint-yaml
```

To run license compliance validation:

```bash
make license-check
```

Follow the below steps only in case the above iGPU driver is not installed.

1. The steps to install iGPU driver on 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processor is described here:
[Configurations for Intel® Processor Graphics (GPU) with OpenVINO™](https://docs.openvino.ai/2026/get-started/install-openvino/configurations/configurations-intel-gpu.html)

2. Reboot the target after installation.

##### Install intel-ipu6 driver

1. Create a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ipu6.conf file and add the following. This will prevent the loading of the existing intel_ipu6_isys driver.

    ```bash
     # kernel builtin IPU6 and Realsense D4xx driver clash with intel-ipu6-dkms
     blacklist intel_ipu6_isys
     blacklist intel_ipu6_psys
     blacklist intel_ipu6
    ```

2. Reboot the target.
3. Install the intel-ipu6-dkms.

   ```bash
    sudo apt install intel-ipu6-dkms
   ```

4. Run the following command for dkms to force install the intel-ipu6 driver.

   ```bash
     dkms install --force ipu6-drivers/20230621+iotgipu6-0eci8
   ```

5. Check the dkms status by running the following command.

   ```bash
   dkms status
   ```

6. Manually modprobe the installed intel-ipu6 driver.

   ```bash
     sudo modprobe intel-ipu6-isys
   ```

7. Once installed check the status of the intel-ipu6 driver using the below command. The file loaded must be: ***/lib/modules/5.15.0-1048-intel-iotg/updates/dkms/intel-ipu6-isys.ko*** as shown below.

   ```bash
   modinfo intel-ipu6-isys | head -3
   ```

   ```text
    filename:       /lib/modules/5.15.0-1048-intel-iotg/updates/dkms/intel-ipu6-isys.ko
    description:    Intel ipu input system driver
    license:        GPL
   ```

##### Install librealsense2 and RealSense tools

Install the librealsense2 and the RealSense tools using the below commands.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-librealsense2-tools
```

##### Add the USER to the video and render group

Add the $USER to the video and render group using the following command.

```bash
 sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
 sudo usermod -a -G render $USER
```

### Running the Demo

#### Using Docker Container

Run the demo using Docker:

```bash
make demo
```

This will:
- Enable X11 forwarding (`xhost +`)
- Start the Docker container with proper device access
- Launch the AI demo with the default configuration

To run with different camera configurations, use one of the following config files:

* `config_ros2_v4l2_rs-color-0.js` - for 1x camera input stream
* `config_ros2_v4l2_rs-color-0_1.js` - for 2x camera input streams
* `config_ros2_v4l2_rs-color-0_2.js` - for 3x camera input streams
* `config_ros2_v4l2_rs-color-0_3.js` - for 4x camera input streams (default)

To use a different configuration, modify the demo target in the Makefile or run the container manually:

```bash
make bash

# Inside the container:
cd src
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
source /opt/intel/openvino/setupvars.sh
python3 pyrealsense2_ai_demo_launcher.py --config=../config/<your-config-file>.js
```

#### Using Installed Package (Axiomtek Robox500 with 4x RealSense GMSL Cameras)

Run the below command to start the application.

```bash
. /opt/ros/humble/share/pyrealsense2-ai-demo/venv/bin/activate
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Command to run the demo application for 4x camera input streams:
python3 /opt/ros/humble/bin/pyrealsense2_ai_demo_launcher.py --config=/opt/ros/humble/share/pyrealsense2-ai-demo/config/config_ros2_v4l2_rs-color-0_3.js
```

All the four cameras are started, after approx 15-20sec, as shown in the below picture.

### Troubleshooting

1. ***iGPU driver not found even after installing the driver.***

   For example:

   ```bash
   sudo intel_gpu_top
   ```

   ```text
    intel_gpu_top: ../tools/intel_gpu_top.c:1909: init_engine_classes: Assertion `max >= 0' failed.
    Aborted
   ```

   **Solution**: The issue is resolved by creating the following symbolic link.

   ```bash
     sudo ln -s /lib/firmware/i915/adlp_guc_70.1.1.bin /lib/firmware/i915/adlp_guc_70.0.3.bin
   ```

2. ***Stability issue or GPU hang error.***

One of the windows get stuck and GPU hang error is observed 2 out 5 runs of the demo when it is run for more than 10-15mins with 3x or more instances of AI workload is run on iGPU.

   ```bash
    [ 1228.692171] perf: interrupt took too long (3136 > 3126), lowering kernel.perf_event_max_sample_rate to 63750
    [ 1675.286683] perf: interrupt took too long (3924 > 3920), lowering kernel.perf_event_max_sample_rate to 50750

    [ 1831.944565] i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] HuC firmware i915/tgl_huc_7.9.3.bin version 7.9
    [ 1831.961857] i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] HuC authenticated
    [ 1831.962252] i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] GuC submission enabled
    [ 1831.962254] i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] GuC SLPC enabled
   ```

**Solution**: The issue is resolved by adding the following kernel command line argument into the grub file. This will disable the dynamic power management of the GPU.
Open the /etc/default/grub file. Add the following to the **GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX**, save the file and update the grub.

   ```bash
    # Add the following line to the /etc/default/grub file
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="i915.enable_dc=0"

    # Save the file and do update grub
   sudo update-grub


Reboot the system.
