# ITS Path Planner ROS 2 Navigation Plugin

---

Intelligent Sampling and Two-Way Search (ITS) global path planner is an
Intel® patented algorithm.

The ITS Plugin for the ROS 2 Navigation 2 application plugin is a global
path planner module that is based on Intelligent sampling and Two-way
Search (ITS).

ITS is a new search approach based on two-way path planning and
intelligent sampling, which reduces the compute time by about 20x-30x on
a 1000 nodes map comparing with the A\* search algorithm. The inputs are
the 2D occupancy grid map, the robot position, and the goal position.
It does not support continuous replanning.

**Prerequisites:** Use a simple behavior tree with a compute path to pose
and a follow path.

*ITS planner inputs:*

- global 2D costmap (`nav2_costmap_2d::Costmap2D`)
- start and goal pose (`geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped`)

*ITS planner outputs:*

- 2D waypoints of the path

**Path planning steps summary:**

1. The ITS planner converts the 2D costmap to either a Probabilistic
    Road Map (PRM) or a Deterministic Road Map (DRM).
2. The generated roadmap is saved as a txt file which can be reused for
    multiple inquiries.
3. The ITS planner conducts a two-way search to find a path from the
    source to the destination. Either the smoothing filter or a catmull
    spline interpolation can be used to create a smooth and continuous
    path. The generated smooth path is in the form of a ROS 2 navigation
    message type (`nav_msgs::msg`).

## Getting Started

Robotics AI Dev Kit provides a ROS 2 Deb package for the application,
supported by the following platforms:

- ROS 2 version: humble or jazzy

## Prerequisites

- [Prepare the target system](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html)
- [Setup the Robotics AI Dev Kit APT Repositories](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#set-up-the-autonomous-mobile-robot-apt-repositories)
- [Install OpenVINO™ Packages](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#install-openvino-packages)
- [Install Robotics AI Dev Kit Deb packages](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#install-autonomous-mobile-robot-deb-packages)
- [Install the Intel® NPU Driver on Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors (if applicable)](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/robotics/gsg_robot/index.html#install-the-intel-npu-driver-on-intel-core-ultra-processors)

## Install Deb package

Install the `ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-its-planner` Deb package from the Intel®
Robotics AI Dev Kit APT repository

> ``` bash
> sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-its-planner
> ```

Run the following script to set environment variables:

> ``` bash
> source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash        # ROS_DISTRO=humble or jazzy
> export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
>
> # Set Gazebo model path (variable name differs between distributions)
> if [ "$ROS_DISTRO" = "jazzy" ]; then
>     export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH:/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models
> else
>     export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models
> fi
> ```

To launch the default ITS planner which is based on differential drive
robot, run:

> ``` bash
> ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py \
>   headless:=False \
>   params_file:=/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/its_planner/nav2_params_${ROS_DISTRO}.yaml \
>   default_bt_xml_filename:=/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/its_planner/navigate_w_recovery_${ROS_DISTRO}.xml
> ```

ITS Planner also supports Ackermann steering; to launch the Ackermann
ITS planner run:

> ``` bash
> ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py \
>   headless:=False \
>   params_file:=/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/its_planner/nav2_params_dubins_${ROS_DISTRO}.yaml \
>   default_bt_xml_filename:=/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share/its_planner/navigate_w_recovery_${ROS_DISTRO}.xml
> ```

[!NOTE]
> The above command opens Gazebo\* and rviz2 applications. Gazebo\*
> takes a longer time to open (up to a minute) depending on the host\'s
> capabilities. Both applications contain the simulated waffle map, and
> a simulated robot. Initially, the applications are opened in the
> background, but you can bring them into the foreground, side-by-side,
> for a better visual.

a.  Set the robot **2D Pose Estimate** in rviz2:
    1.  Set the initial robot pose by pressing **2D Pose Estimate** in
        rviz2.
    2.  At the robot estimated location, down-click inside the 2D map.
        For reference, use the robot pose as it appears in Gazebo\*.
    3.  Set the orientation by dragging forward from the down-click.
        This also enables ROS 2 navigation.

b.  In rviz2, press **Navigation2 Goal**, and choose a destination for
    the robot. This calls the behavioral tree navigator to go to that
    goal through an action server.

    **Expected result:** The robot moves along the path generated to its
    new destination.

c.  Set new destinations for the robot, one at a time.

d.  To close this, do the following:
    - Type `Ctrl-c` in the terminal where you did the up command.
