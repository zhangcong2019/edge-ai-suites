# LIO SLAM: Point-LIO

Point-LIO is a robust, high-bandwidth LiDAR-Inertial Odometry system built on
a point-by-point EKF update (no per-frame accumulation, so no in-frame
motion distortion) and a stochastic-process-augmented kinematic model that
tolerates IMU saturation during aggressive motion.

![Point-LIO system overview](https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO/raw/master/image/toc4.png)

- Paper: [Point-LIO: Robust High-Bandwidth Light Detection and Ranging Inertial Odometry](https://doi.org/10.1002/aisy.202200459) (He, Xu, Chen, Kong, Yuan, Zhang — *Advanced Intelligent Systems*, 2023, DOI 10.1002/aisy.202200459)
- Upstream: [hku-mars/Point-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO) (`point-lio-with-grid-map` branch)

In Robotics AI Suite, the upstream tree is a pristine git submodule and Intel
changes ship as patches on top, so Point-LIO can be evaluated as an
alternative LIO backend without forking the reference navigation stack.

> [!NOTE]
> Point-LIO's [LICENSE](https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO/blob/point-lio-with-grid-map/LICENSE) is **BSD-3-Clause**, and its

## Changes to 3rd party source

This work is based on the open-source
[Point-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO.git) repository
(`point-lio-with-grid-map` branch), pinned in
[.gitmodules](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/.gitmodules) at the upstream commit the patch below
applies to.

| Patch | Change |
| ----- | ------ |
| [0001-Port-Point-LIO-to-ROS2-and-add-benchmarking-instrume.patch](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/patches/0001-Port-Point-LIO-to-ROS2-and-add-benchmarking-instrume.patch) | Full ROS1/catkin → ROS2/ament_cmake port (rclcpp, `livox_ros_driver2`, a ROS2 launch file); new `avia_ros2.yaml`/`mid360_ros2.yaml`/`velodyne_urbanloco.yaml` configs — the last one is the UrbanLoco `ulhk_4` config used for validation below; opt-in latency-profiling CSV (below); `MP_PROC_NUM_CPUSET` CMake option to pin OpenMP thread count to the algorithm's cpuset; a segfault fix for point clouds without a `time` field; and alignment of Avia point filtering with FAST-LIO2 for fair benchmarking. |

**Profiling**: built behind the `ENABLE_PROFILING` CMake option (off by
default, matching upstream). When enabled, a lock-free ring buffer plus a
dedicated writer thread records per-stage timing (using `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`,
immune to PTP clock steps) to `Point-LIO/Log/point_lio_profiling.csv`.

## Environment setup (Ubuntu 24.04 / ROS 2 Jazzy)

```bash
# 1. Fetch the pristine upstream submodule (no --recursive needed - this
# Point-LIO branch has no nested submodule)
git submodule update --init robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/Point-LIO

cd robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/scripts

# 2. One-time host dependencies (needs sudo; safe to re-run)
./install_deps.sh

# 3. Apply the Intel patch from the table above
./apply_patches.sh

# 4. Build point_lio with colcon
./build.sh
```

All paths, the ROS distro, and the dataset sequence used below are
centralized in [scripts/env.sh](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/scripts/env.sh) — edit that one file to
retarget a different workspace/sequence; nothing else needs to change.

## Validate without hardware: UrbanLoco dataset replay

No robot or sensor is required to verify the build and measure accuracy: the
`ulhk_4` sequence (`HK-Data20190117`) from the public
[UrbanLoco dataset](https://github.com/weisongwen/UrbanLoco) (PolyU IPN-Lab,
ICRA 2020; official site
[advdataset2019.wixsite.com/urbanloco](https://advdataset2019.wixsite.com/urbanloco/hong-kong))
is replayed through `pointlio_mapping` and compared against its NovAtel
SPAN-CPT-derived ground truth.

```bash
./fetch_ulhk.sh            # download the raw bag (Google Drive, via gdown - see below if slow)
./convert_ulhk_to_bag.sh   # one-time conversion into a standard ROS 2 bag, if needed
./run_ulhk.sh              # launch pointlio_mapping + `ros2 bag play` the converted bag, records the trajectory
./evaluate_rmse.sh         # evo_ape RMSE vs. ground truth, printed next to the documented baseline

# or, once install_deps.sh has been run once:
./reproduce_all.sh # apply patch -> build -> fetch -> convert -> run -> evaluate, in one command
```

UrbanLoco's file is hosted on Google Drive, which needs a large-file
confirmation step that plain `wget`/`curl` can't complete alone —
`fetch_ulhk.sh` uses `gdown` (installed by `install_deps.sh`) to automate
that. If it's slow or rate-limited on your network, the script prints the
exact manual-download URL, the file to grab, and the exact directory to
place it in; re-run `./fetch_ulhk.sh` afterward (it detects the file is
already present) or continue straight to `./convert_ulhk_to_bag.sh`.

During replay, `pointlio_mapping`'s own log will repeat
`Failed to find match for field 'time'.` once per LiDAR scan for the whole
run — this is **expected and harmless**, not a sign of a broken pipeline.
It's a PCL-level warning (see `Point-LIO/README.md`'s note C) that the
incoming `PointCloud2` has no per-point timestamp field; UrbanLoco's 2019
Velodyne recording predates that convention, so Point-LIO falls back to
estimating each point's capture time from scan geometry instead (still
correct, just an internal fallback path). This is specific to this public
dataset's age — a real Velodyne (or other) LiDAR driver on live hardware
does populate that field, so production/live-sensor runs of this pipeline
won't print this at all.

For `ulhk_4`, the documented baseline is **2.17 m** RMSE (Point-LIO paper,
DOI 10.1002/aisy.202200459, Table 5). FAST-LIO2's own paper (Xu et al. 2022,
IEEE T-RO, Table IV) reports 2.57 m on the same sequence, printed alongside
for context only, not compared against. The check is one-sided: it passes
as long as the freshly measured RMSE does not exceed the Point-LIO baseline
by more than `RMSE_TOLERANCE_PCT` (20% by default) — a measured RMSE *lower*
than the baseline always passes, since the check exists to catch
regressions, not to flag outperforming the paper's own number.

### Rviz visualization

`run_ulhk.sh` gates `rviz2` behind the `USE_RVIZ` variable in
[scripts/env.sh](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/scripts/env.sh), off by default so the flow stays headless
over SSH:

```bash
USE_RVIZ=true ./run_ulhk.sh   # or: USE_RVIZ=true ./reproduce_all.sh
```

Run this directly on the target machine's own logged-in Ubuntu desktop
session (e.g. on the PTL board's display, not over plain SSH) — rviz2's
point-cloud rendering needs a real GPU display, so X11-forwarding it over
SSH is impractical.

### Reference: running on Intel PTL

`run_ulhk.sh` ships a reference core-pinning + frequency-locking setup for
Intel PTL (validated on Core Ultra X7 358H: 4 P-cores `cpu0-3` up to 4700
MHz, 8 E-cores `cpu4-11` up to 3500 MHz, 4 LP-E-cores `cpu12-15` up to 3300
MHz). Core numbering is specific to this SKU — re-check `lscpu -e` before
reusing these defaults on a different PTL SKU or platform.

| Task | Pinned to | Why |
| ---- | --------- | --- |
| `pointlio_mapping` algorithm | LP-E cores `12,13` (`CPUSET_ALGO`) | Keeps the timing-critical LIO thread on isolated cores the general scheduler and rest of the OS don't touch. |
| `ros2 bag play` of the converted UrbanLoco bag | P-core `1` (`CPUSET_BAG`) | Replaying the pre-converted bag is bursty I/O + decode work; a dedicated P-core keeps it from stealing cycles from the algorithm cores. |
| `rviz2` (when `USE_RVIZ=true`) | P-core `2` (`CPUSET_RVIZ`) | Point-cloud rendering is bursty GUI work best kept off the algorithm's isolated cores; a P-core has the headroom for it. |

`run_ulhk.sh` wraps the algorithm and `ros2 bag play` with `taskset -c` and,
best-effort, `sudo -n chrt -f -a -p 85 <pid>` SCHED_FIFO priority-85 —
applied to the process *after* it's already launched as the invoking
(non-root) user, not chained into the launch itself, so it inherits this
script's own exported environment (`ROS_DOMAIN_ID`/`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION`/
`CYCLONEDDS_URI`) unchanged — whenever the matching `CPUSET_*` variable in
[scripts/env.sh](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/scripts/env.sh) is non-empty (the default). Since `ros2
run` (used to launch the algorithm) `subprocess.Popen()`s the actual
`pointlio_mapping` binary as a separate child rather than exec()'ing into
it, `chrt` is applied to that whole process tree, not just the top PID —
otherwise only the idle Python wrapper gets SCHED_FIFO and the real
workload runs unprioritized (confirmed 2026-08-03: this let
`pointlio_mapping` fall behind real-time on the LP-E cores during a
full-length `ulhk_4` run and exhaust the iceoryx SHM mempool). `rviz2` gets
`taskset` pinning only, no realtime priority. If `sudo -n` isn't usable (no
passwordless sudoers entry for `chrt`), the script warns and continues
unprioritized rather than failing the run. To disable pinning for a given
task, blank out its variable in `env.sh` (e.g. `CPUSET_ALGO=""`).

Every process `run_ulhk.sh` launches — including the RT-prioritized ones —
stays owned by the invoking user throughout, never root: `chrt -p <pid>`
only changes an already-running process's scheduling class via `sudo`'s
privilege, it never re-execs or changes that process's own UID. This
matters beyond file ownership — it's required for correctness when
`USE_DDS_SHM=true` (see below): a RouDi shared-memory daemon started by the
invoking user rejects registration from a root-owned client (`iceoryx`'s
Unix-domain registration socket creation fails across that UID boundary),
which otherwise surfaces as a fatal `Timeout registering at RouDi. Is RouDi
running?` and aborts the process.

For apples-to-apples benchmarking, lock every core's governor and min/max
frequency (and, as a stronger hardware-level backstop, the HWP MSR
request) before measuring:

```bash
sudo ./limit_ptl_cores.sh
```

This requires root and prints a per-core summary of the governor/min/max
frequency actually applied. Its targets (`FREQ_P_CORES`/`FREQ_E_CORES`/
`FREQ_LPE_CORES`, `FREQ_*_MAX`/`FREQ_*_MIN`, `CPU_MODE_P`/`CPU_MODE_E`) are
also in `env.sh`.

### Optional: production-equivalent CycloneDDS + iceoryx shared-memory setup

[scripts/env.sh](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/scripts/env.sh) already defaults `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` to
`rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` and `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to `200`, but that alone is still
plain CycloneDDS with no iceoryx zero-copy shared-memory transport for
same-host pub/sub. [scripts/setup_dds_shm.sh](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/point-lio-demo/scripts/setup_dds_shm.sh) adds
that missing piece — the same DDS transport Bing's own benchmark harness for
this project (`run_live_benchmark.sh`) uses on PTL/Orin, for two reasons:
(1) `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`/plain-CycloneDDS + SHM has hit CDR deserialize
failures on large `PointCloud2` bag replay — silently corrupting or dropping
frames — and (2) a dedicated DDS domain plus this transport keeps traffic
isolated and fast on a single host.

```bash
./setup_dds_shm.sh start   # installs cyclonedds/iceoryx apt packages, writes
                            # generated/cyclonedds_shm.xml + roudi_config.toml,
                            # stops any already-running iox-roudi (even an
                            # orphaned one from a previous session) and
                            # starts a fresh one with this config
./run_ulhk.sh               # picks up CYCLONEDDS_URI automatically once iox-roudi is running
./setup_dds_shm.sh stop    # stop iox-roudi when done
./setup_dds_shm.sh status  # check whether iox-roudi is currently running
```

This is on by default (`USE_DDS_SHM=true` in `env.sh`) — `reproduce_all.sh`
runs `./setup_dds_shm.sh start` as one of its steps, and every colleague or
customer is free to opt out entirely (plain CycloneDDS, no SHM, no
`iox-roudi` dependency at all):

```bash
USE_DDS_SHM=false ./reproduce_all.sh
# or edit scripts/env.sh: USE_DDS_SHM="false"
```

If `run_ulhk.sh` is run directly (not via `reproduce_all.sh`) and
`./setup_dds_shm.sh start` was never run first, it warns and falls back to
plain CycloneDDS rather than failing the run.

## Manual reproduction (no scripts)

Everything above is what `scripts/*.sh` automate. This section spells out
the same steps by hand — for anyone who'd rather not run scripts, or who's
forking this pipeline and wants to see exactly what each step does before
changing it. Every path/value below is one of `scripts/env.sh`'s own
defaults; run these commands from inside `pipelines/point-lio-demo` (all
relative paths are relative to that directory, matching `env.sh`'s own
`DEMO_DIR`).

### 1. Host dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libpcl-dev libeigen3-dev \
  ros-jazzy-pcl-conversions ros-jazzy-common-interfaces \
  ros-jazzy-tf2 ros-jazzy-tf2-ros ros-jazzy-tf2-geometry-msgs \
  ros-jazzy-rosbag2 ros-jazzy-rosbag2-storage-default-plugins
pip install --user --break-system-packages gdown rosbags evo
```

`point_lio`'s `CMakeLists.txt`/`package.xml` unconditionally depend on
`livox_ros_driver2` (see "Limitations / non-goals" below), which in turn
needs Livox-SDK2 built from source — GCC ≥13's libstdc++ stopped pulling in
`<cstdint>` transitively, so v1.3.1's headers need it force-included:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 -b v1.3.1 https://github.com/Livox-SDK/Livox-SDK2.git /tmp/livox-sdk2
cmake -S /tmp/livox-sdk2 -B /tmp/livox-sdk2/build -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-include cstdint"
cmake --build /tmp/livox-sdk2/build -j"$(nproc)"
sudo cmake --install /tmp/livox-sdk2/build
```

### 2. Apply the Intel patch

```bash
cd Point-LIO
git am --keep-cr ../patches/0001-Port-Point-LIO-to-ROS2-and-add-benchmarking-instrume.patch
cd ..
```

(`git am` fails on a dirty or already-patched tree — `apply_patches.sh`'s
extra safety is only needed if you're re-running this against an edited
`.patch` file.)

### 3. Build with colcon

```bash
mkdir -p ~/point_lio_ws/src
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/Point-LIO" ~/point_lio_ws/src/point_lio
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

git clone --depth 1 -b 1.2.6 https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2.git ~/point_lio_ws/src/livox_ros_driver2
cp ~/point_lio_ws/src/livox_ros_driver2/package_ROS2.xml ~/point_lio_ws/src/livox_ros_driver2/package.xml

cd ~/point_lio_ws
colcon build --cmake-args -DROS_EDITION=ROS2 -DDISTRO_ROS=jazzy --packages-select livox_ros_driver2
source install/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select point_lio   # add --cmake-args -DENABLE_PROFILING=ON for the latency CSV
cd -
```

### 4. Fetch the UrbanLoco dataset (`ulhk_4`, session `HK-Data20190117`)

```bash
mkdir -p datasets/ulhk_4
```

Automate it with `gdown` (handles Google Drive's large-file confirmation
step, which plain `wget`/`curl` can't complete alone):

```bash
gdown 17JQNs8_Mf2t4nvLUsF76AD6fxaTbZdFg -O datasets/ulhk_4/HK-Data20190117.bag
```

If that's slow, rate-limited, or blocked on your network, download the
`HK-Data20190117` session yourself from the official UrbanLoco GitHub repo
(<https://github.com/weisongwen/UrbanLoco>) using whatever method works for
you, then place the file at exactly `datasets/ulhk_4/HK-Data20190117.bag`.

### 5. Convert to a ROS 2 bag

UrbanLoco's public download is a ROS1 bag:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
rosbags-convert --src datasets/ulhk_4/HK-Data20190117.bag --dst datasets/ulhk_4/ulhk_bag
```

### 6. Run `pointlio_mapping` against the bag

Two terminals. **Terminal A — the algorithm:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/point_lio_ws/install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=200

ros2 run point_lio pointlio_mapping --ros-args \
  --params-file ~/point_lio_ws/install/point_lio/share/point_lio/config/velodyne_urbanloco.yaml
```

**Terminal B — bag playback + trajectory recording** (start once Terminal A
is up and printing):

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=200

python3 scripts/record_odometry_tum.py --topic /aft_mapped_to_init --out datasets/ulhk_4/results/ulhk_4_est_tum.txt &
ros2 bag play datasets/ulhk_4/ulhk_bag
```

`ros2 bag play` runs at the recorded (real-time) rate — `ulhk_4` is ~5:18.
Once it exits, wait a couple of seconds for the last odometry messages to
land, then stop the recorder (`kill %1` in Terminal B) and
`pointlio_mapping` (`Ctrl-C` in Terminal A — a clean SIGTERM, not `kill -9`,
so its destructor flushes any open CSV writer). The core-pinning/SCHED_FIFO
wrapping `run_ulhk.sh` applies on PTL (taskset/chrt) is an optional
performance extra, not required for a correctness repro — see "Reference:
running on Intel PTL" above if you want that too.

**Optional — the CycloneDDS+iceoryx shared-memory transport, by hand**
(equivalent to `scripts/setup_dds_shm.sh start` — run that script instead if
you don't need to customize this):

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  ros-jazzy-cyclonedds ros-jazzy-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp \
  ros-jazzy-iceoryx-posh ros-jazzy-iceoryx-hoofs ros-jazzy-iceoryx-binding-c

MY_IP=$(ip route get 1.1.1.1 | awk '/src/{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if ($i=="src") print $(i+1)}')
mkdir -p scripts/generated
cat > scripts/generated/cyclonedds_shm.xml <<EOF
<CycloneDDS><Domain><General>
  <AllowMulticast>true</AllowMulticast>
</General><Discovery><Peers><Peer Address="$MY_IP"/></Peers></Discovery>
<SharedMemory>
  <Enable>true</Enable>
  <LogLevel>warn</LogLevel>
</SharedMemory>
</Domain></CycloneDDS>
EOF
```

`AllowMulticast` must be `true`, not `false` — `false` plus a unicast `Peer`
pointing at your own IP reliably breaks same-host node discovery on some
machines (confirmed on Orin).

```bash
cat > scripts/generated/roudi_config.toml <<'EOF'
[general]
version = 1

[[segment]]
[[segment.mempool]]
size = 128
count = 10000
[[segment.mempool]]
size = 1024
count = 5000
[[segment.mempool]]
size = 16384
count = 1000
[[segment.mempool]]
size = 131072
count = 200
[[segment.mempool]]
size = 524288
count = 50
[[segment.mempool]]
size = 1048576
count = 30
[[segment.mempool]]
size = 4194304
count = 100
EOF

pkill -x iox-roudi 2>/dev/null; sleep 1   # replace any already-running instance, don't run two
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
iox-roudi -c scripts/generated/roudi_config.toml --monitoring-mode off &
sleep 2
pgrep -x iox-roudi && echo "RouDi is up"
```

The mempool sizes above are sized for full `PointCloud2` scans — RouDi's own
stock example config is too small and silently drops SHM segments instead of
erroring. The largest pool's `count` is 100, not RouDi's smaller stock
value, after a full-length `ulhk_4` run (~10Hz scans over 5:21) hit
`MemoryManager: unable to acquire a chunk`/
`MEPOO__MEMPOOL_GETCHUNK_POOL_IS_RUNNING_OUT_OF_CHUNKS` — see `scripts/
run_ulhk.sh`'s `ptl_wrap` comment for the actual root cause (real-time
priority wasn't reaching `pointlio_mapping`'s actual process), this pool
bump is just extra headroom on top of that fix. `--monitoring-mode off` is
required: RouDi's default liveness monitor evicts any participant that
misses a ~1.5s heartbeat, which CPU-isolation/governor/SCHED_FIFO changes
can trigger even on a healthy process. Always stop any already-running
`iox-roudi` before starting a new one (as above) — an old instance left
over from a previous session will keep running with its own (possibly
stale) config instead of erroring, since a second RouDi wouldn't overwrite
it.

Then, in **every** shell that needs to see the algorithm node (Terminal A,
Terminal B, and any `rviz2`/`ros2 node list` shell), export one more variable
before sourcing the ROS setup files:

```bash
export CYCLONEDDS_URI="file://$(pwd)/scripts/generated/cyclonedds_shm.xml"
```

Verify with `ros2 node list` (should show `/pointlio_mapping` within ~1s of
launching it). When done: stop `pointlio_mapping`/`ros2 bag play`, then
`pkill -x iox-roudi`.

### 7. Evaluate RMSE

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_ulhk_gt.py \
  --bag-dir datasets/ulhk_4/ulhk_bag \
  --topic /novatel_data/inspvax \
  --out datasets/ulhk_4/results/ulhk_4_gt_tum.txt

pip install --user --break-system-packages evo   # if not already installed
evo_ape tum datasets/ulhk_4/results/ulhk_4_gt_tum.txt datasets/ulhk_4/results/ulhk_4_est_tum.txt -a
```

Compare the printed RMSE against the documented `ulhk_4` baseline of
**2.17 m** (Point-LIO paper, DOI 10.1002/aisy.202200459, Table 5) — a fresh
measurement up to 20% above that baseline is an expected pass, since the
check exists to catch regressions rather than to require beating the
paper's own number.

## Limitations / non-goals

- **Validated end-to-end on Intel PTL** (Core Ultra X7 358H): a full
  `reproduce_all.sh`-equivalent run (patch → build → run → evaluate)
  produced a measured RMSE of **1.859 m** on `ulhk_4`, comfortably passing
  the ≤2.604 m (baseline × 1.20) gate against the documented 2.17 m
  Point-LIO baseline.
- Validated here: functional LIO operation and pose-tracking accuracy
  (RMSE) against the public UrbanLoco baseline, on a Velodyne HDL-32E LiDAR.
- `point_lio`'s build unconditionally depends on `livox_ros_driver2` (and
  transitively Livox-SDK2), even though this pipeline only ever runs the
  Velodyne/UrbanLoco path — confirmed in `CMakeLists.txt`/`package.xml`, not
  a choice made by this integration.
- Ground truth (`scripts/extract_ulhk_gt.py`) reads NovAtel SPAN-CPT
  INSPVAX messages directly out of the converted bag's `.db3` file by fixed
  CDR byte offset, rather than deserializing through the
  `novatel_oem7_msgs` package definitions — this avoids an extra ROS
  package dependency just to read ground truth, but is specific to the CDR
  layout of that message type as recorded in this dataset; re-verify the
  byte offsets (`_OFF_LAT`/`_OFF_LON`/`_OFF_HGT` in that script) if adapting
  this to a different bag.
- Only `ulhk_4` has a confirmed session/Google-Drive ID and documented
  baseline; `ulhk_5`/`ulhk_6` are structural placeholders in
  `scripts/env.sh` for future extension, not yet populated.
- The converted `ulhk_4` bag's `PointCloud2` has no per-point `time` field
  (see "Validate without hardware" above for why `pointlio_mapping` logs
  "Failed to find match for field 'time'" once per scan because of this).
  This is non-fatal — Point-LIO falls back to a scan-rate-based per-point
  time estimate — and the 1.859 m measured RMSE already reflects this; it
  is not a config bug to fix.
- `ros2 bag play` skips republishing `ublox_msgs`/`novatel_oem7_msgs`-typed
  topics (including the ground-truth `/novatel_data/inspvax`) since those
  packages aren't installed by `install_deps.sh` — expected and harmless,
  since `extract_ulhk_gt.py` reads ground truth directly from the bag's own
  `.db3` file rather than subscribing to a live topic.
- Google Drive's automated-download detection can temporarily gate this
  specific shared file behind a sign-in wall (confirmed in practice — not a
  proxy/network issue, reproduced identically from two different networks);
  `fetch_ulhk.sh`'s manual-download fallback exists for exactly this case.
- UrbanLoco's terms of use should be checked on the
  [dataset's own page](https://advdataset2019.wixsite.com/urbanloco/hong-kong)
  before redistributing any downloaded data.
- BSD-3-Clause licensing (see callout above) applies to the upstream code
  as-is; this integration does not change that.
