# RouDi's Unix-domain registration socket creation is rejected across that

# as a bonus - it inherits this script's exported environment
# (ROS_DOMAIN_ID/RMW_IMPLEMENTATION/CYCLONEDDS_URI included) exactly as-is,
# with no re-export/re-source dance needed. `-a`/`--all-tasks` applies the
# priority to every thread of the target pid, not just its main thread -
