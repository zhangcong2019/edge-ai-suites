# VSLAM: ORB-SLAM3

SLAM(Simultaneous localization and mapping) is a major research problem in the robotics community, where a great deal of effort has been devoted to developing new methods to maximize their robustness and reliability.

VSLAM (visual SLAM) utilizes camera(s) as the primary source of sensor input to sense the surrounding environment. This can be done either with a single camera, multiple cameras, and with or without an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that measure translational and rotational movements.

Feature-based tracking algorithm is main-stream implementation for VSLAM, according to its real-time and simplified SLAM process.

ORB-SLAM3 is one of popular real-time feature-based SLAM libraries able to perform Visual, Visual-Inertial and Multi-Map SLAM with monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras, using pin-hole and fisheye lens models. In all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure you have all the prerequisites and installation in [Get Started](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/embodied/get_started.html) before proceeding.
> And follow the guide [Install Realsense SDK](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/embodied/get-started/installation/realsense.html) to install Realsense SDK.

## Installation

1. Make sure Realsense SDK installed. If not, follow [Install Realsense SDK](
https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/embodied/get-started/installation/realsense.html) to install Realsense packages.

Here is a minimal installation:

```bash
sudo apt install librealsense2
```

2. Install the ORB-SLAM3 packages by following the below command:

```bash
sudo apt install orb-slam3
```

After installation, the VSLAM example programs are installed under folder ``/opt/intel/orb-slam3``.

## VSLAM Demos

### Demo-1: Monocular Camera with Mono-Dataset

This Demo uses EUROC dataset to test ORB-SLAM3 monocular mode.

![orb-slam3-mono](README.assets/orb-slam3-mono.gif)

1. Download the EUROC MAV Dataset files

```bash
mkdir -p ~/orb-slam3/dataset
cd ~/orb-slam3/dataset
wget http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/machine_hall/MH_04_difficult/MH_04_difficult.zip
unzip MH_04_difficult.zip -d MH04
```

> [!NOTE]
> This demo uses `MH_04_difficult dataset`. If you want to try other dataset, you may download them from the link: https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets.

2. Launch ORB-SLAM3 Demo pipeline

Run the below commands in a bash terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/orb-slam3/log
cd ~/orb-slam3/
/opt/intel/orb-slam3/Examples/Monocular/mono_euroc /opt/intel/orb-slam3/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt /opt/intel/orb-slam3/Examples/Monocular/EuRoC.yaml ~/orb-slam3/dataset/MH04/ /opt/intel/orb-slam3/Examples/Monocular/EuRoC_TimeStamps/MH04.txt  ~/orb-slam3/log/MH04_mono.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use other datasets other than `MH_04_difficult`, you should make sure you update the command above with the correct name of dataset you use.

### Demo-2: VSLAM Demo with Intel Realsense Camera

This Demo uses Intel Realsense Camera as stereo inputs.

![orb-slam3-realsense](README.assets/orb-slam3-realsense.gif)

1. Connect a Realsense D435 or D435i Camera to the test machine

2. Launch ORB-SLAM3 Demo pipeline

Run the below command in a bash terminal:

```bash
/opt/intel/orb-slam3/Examples/Stereo/stereo_realsense_D435i /opt/intel/orb-slam3/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt /opt/intel/orb-slam3/Examples/Stereo/RealSense_D435i.yaml
```

## Building ORB-SLAM3 Debian package

This step-by-step guide will detail how to build ORB-SLAM3 into a Debian package. Execute the following steps on an Ubuntu-based Linux development system:

1. Install prerequiste development tools:

```bash
apt update
apt install build-essential make cmake git wget debhelper devscripts equivs
```

2. Add the ECI APT repository to your APT sources:

```bash
sudo -E wget -O- https://eci.intel.com/repos/gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-ECI.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/eci-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/eci-archive-keyring.gpg] https://eci.intel.com/repos/$(source /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) isar main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/eci.list
```

3. Add the Intel RealSense APT repository to your APT sources:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -sSf https://librealsense.realsenseai.com/Debian/librealsenseai.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/librealsenseai.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/librealsenseai.gpg] https://librealsense.realsenseai.com/Debian/apt-repo `lsb_release -cs` main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/librealsense.list
```

4. Update your APT sources:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

5. Clone the Robotics AI Suite source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.2.0 --recurse-submodules
```

6. Copy the Robotics AI Suite ORB-SLAM3 patches:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/components/orb-slam3-sample
cp ./patches/* ./ORB_SLAM3
```

7. Apply the patches:

```bash
cd ORB_SLAM3
git apply *.patch
rm *.patch
```

8. Install the package build dependencies:

```bash
sudo mk-build-deps -i --host-arch amd64 --build-arch amd64 -t "apt-get -y -q -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes --no-install-recommends --allow-downgrades" debian/control
```

9. Build the Debian package:
