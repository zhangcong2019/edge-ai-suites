# order (rather than chaining `chrt -f 85 taskset ... exec <cmd>` as one
# root-owned command line, as an earlier version of this script did) is
# deliberate: a root-owned fastlio_mapping process cannot register with an
# iceoryx RouDi daemon started by the invoking (non-root) user - RouDi's
# Unix-domain registration socket creation is rejected across that UID
# boundary ("permission to create unix domain socket denied" in RouDi's own
# log, confirmed on the PTL board 2026-07-27), which iceoryx surfaces as a
# fatal "Timeout registering at RouDi. Is RouDi running?" and aborts the
# process. Keeping <cmd...> running as the invoking user the whole time
# avoids that boundary entirely, and - as a bonus - it inherits this
# script's exported environment (ROS_DOMAIN_ID/RMW_IMPLEMENTATION/
# CYCLONEDDS_URI included) exactly as-is, with no re-export/re-source dance
# needed. `-a`/`--all-tasks` applies the priority to every thread of the
