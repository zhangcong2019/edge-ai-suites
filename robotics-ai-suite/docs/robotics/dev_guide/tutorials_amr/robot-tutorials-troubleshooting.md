# Troubleshooting for Autonomous Mobile Robot Tutorials

## Use `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to Avoid Interference in ROS Messages

A typical method to demonstrate a use case requires you to start several
ROS 2 nodes and exchange ROS 2 messages between the ROS 2 nodes.

However, interference from unrelated nodes -- whether on the same host machine
or within the local network -- can disrupt the process. Debugging and
resolving such interference can be challenging in this scenario.

ROS 2 uses the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` environment variable to isolate several
use cases from each other. For this reason, you should set this variable
to a certain number before you execute a tutorial:

```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<value>
```

The `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` should be an integer between 0 and 101 and it should
be the same for all the nodes launched for a particular use case. If you run only
one use case at a time, you can set this variable in your `.bashrc` file,
as described in the [prepare-ros-environment](../../gsg_robot/index.md#21-prepare-your-ros-2-environment)
section.

## Troubleshooting AAEON Motor Control Board Issues

Several tutorials apply an AAEON UP Xtreme i11 Robotic Development Kit to
demonstrate how the Autonomous Mobile Robot can interact with a physical robot.
The AAEON UP Xtreme i11 Robotic Development Kit includes a motor control board,
which implements the motor drivers and the USB interface towards the compute
board. To support this motor control board, the Autonomous Mobile Robot provides
the Deb package `ros-humble-aaeon-ros2-amr-interface`, which is based on the
GitHub project
[AAEONAEU-SW/ros2_amr_interface](https://github.com/AAEONAEU-SW/ros2_amr_interface)
with some adaptations for ROS 2 Humble.

The following subsections provide solutions to fix potential issues with
the USB interface of the AAEON UP Xtreme i11 Robotic Development Kit.

### Add the current user to the `dialout` group

To control the AAEON UP Xtreme i11 Robotic Development Kit via the USB interface,
the current user must be a member of the `dialout` group. Use the `groups`
command to verify that the current user belongs to the `dialout` group.
If the user does not belong to this group, add the group membership by means of:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

### Solve conflicts with the BRLTTY daemon

BRLTTY is a background process that operates Braille displays, a tool for individuals
who are blind. There is a possibility that BRLTTY may block the USB interface
utilized by the AAEON motor control board. To identify such a conflict,
execute the following command:

```bash
sudo dmesg -w
```

Connect the AAEON motor control board to one of the USB ports of the
compute board. Analyze the output of the `dmesg` command and search for any
messages that contain `BRLTTY` or `brltty`. In the following example, the
lines with the time stamps `7768.502123` and `7768.618382` indicate
that there is a conflict between the BRLTTY daemon and the ch341 driver.

```console
[ 7750.500707] usb 3-4: USB disconnect, device number 11
[ 7767.801366] usb 3-4: New full-speed USB device number 12 using xhci_hcd
[ 7767.951513] usb 3-4: New USB device found, idVendor=1a86, idProduct=7523, bcdDevice= 2.64
[ 7767.951532] usb 3-4: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[ 7767.951537] usb 3-4: Product: USB Serial
[ 7767.953988] ch341 3-4:1.0: ch341-uart converter detected
[ 7767.954920] usb 3-4: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[ 7768.502123] input: BRLTTY 6.4 Linux Screen Driver Keyboard as /devices/virtual/input/input34
[ 7768.618382] usb 3-4: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ch341 while 'brltty' sets config #1
[ 7768.618952] ch341-uart ttyUSB0: ch341-uart converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0
[ 7768.618976] ch341 3-4:1.0: device disconnected
```

To fix this conflict, remove the `brltty` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove brltty
```

## Troubleshooting RViz2 Issues

### Set Scale Display Mode to 100%

If you encounter a segmentation fault or see errors such as
`libGL error: failed to create drawable` when starting RViz2 with the `-d` flag,
the issue may be caused by the display scale mode being set to a value other than 100%.

To resolve this issue, set the display scale mode to 100%:

1. Open the system settings on your Linux system.
2. Navigate to the **Displays** section.
3. Set the **Scale** option to **100%**.

### Enable 3D options in RViz2

> **Note**:
> Displaying in 3D consumes a lot of system resources this may interfere with the robot control commands.
> Intel® recommends opening rviz2 on a development system. The development system needs to be
> in the same network and have the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID set.

To prepare the development system follow the instructions to
[Prepare the Target System](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/rvc/getstarted/prepare_system.html).

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

```bash
# When using different machines, set the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID as on the robot
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<YOUR_ROSID>
rviz2
```

<!--hide_directive:::
:::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
<!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

```bash
# When using different machines, set the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID as on the robot
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<YOUR_ROSID>
rviz2
```

<!--hide_directive:::
::::hide_directive-->

- open options menu in Rviz2

- enable 3D display

## Troubleshooting OpenVINO™ Issues

### File Permission Errors

If you encounter an error stating `permission denied /tmp/pipeline_object.yaml`,
you must adjust the file's ownership and permissions accordingly.
The file ownership can be reassigned using the `chown` command and file
permissions can be adjusted using the `chmod` command.
Execute the following commands in your terminal to make the necessary changes:

```bash
sudo chown $USER /tmp/pipeline_object.yaml
sudo chmod u+x /tmp/pipeline_object.yaml
```

The first command assigns the current user as the owner of
`/tmp/pipeline_object.yaml`, while the second command grants the owner
execute permissions for this file.

### Missing Model files

Some of the OpenVINO™ based tutorials in this SDK rely on the models that are
provided during the installation of the `ros-humble-openvino-node`. In case you
missed out on installing these models you may run into problem when
executing these tutorials.

Follow the instructions on [Install OpenVINO™ Packages](../../gsg_robot/index.md#4-install-openvino-packages),
to troubleshoot potential issues with the OpenVINO™ installation.

## GPU device is not detected with Linux Kernel 6.7.5 or later

According to the
[Release Notes of the Intel® Graphics Compute Runtime](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases/tag/24.09.28717.12),
there is a known incompatibility between the Intel® Graphics Compute Runtime
used in this release of the Autonomous Mobile Robot and the Intel® Graphics Driver
kernel mode driver in Linux Kernel 6.7.5 or later.

For Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors, the recommended operating system for the Autonomous Mobile Robot
is the [Ubuntu OS version 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04)
Desktop image, as described in
[Prepare the Target System](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-suites/robotics-ai-suite/rvc/getstarted/prepare_system.html).
Since this version of the Canonical Ubuntu operating system uses a
Linux Kernel 6.8, this incompatibility will have an impact if you use the
Autonomous Mobile Robot on an Intel® Core™ Ultra Processor.

To test whether your system is impacted, you can use the `clinfo` tool.
You can install and execute this tool by means of:

```bash
sudo apt install clinfo
clinfo | grep "Device Type"
```

The output of the `clinfo` command will report the detected OpenCL™
devices:

```console
Device Type                                     CPU
Device Type                                     GPU
Device Type                                     Accelerator
```

If the list of devices not include the GPU, your system is impacted.

To fix the issue, you can apply the workaround that is recommended in the
[Release Notes of the Intel® Graphics Compute Runtime](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases/tag/24.09.28717.12).
If you export the following debug variables before you run any of the
GPU-related workloads, the GPU will be detected appropriately:

```bash
export NEOReadDebugKeys=1
export OverrideGpuAddressSpace=48
```
