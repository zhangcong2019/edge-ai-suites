# Use the GPU ORB Extractor

This tutorial shows how to use the GPU orb-extractor feature library API.

The GPU orb-extractor feature library offers thread-safe support for both single and multiple cameras.

This tutorial illustrates GPU orb-extractor feature library usage with OpenCV `cv::Mat` and `cv::Keypoints`. It explains using multiple CPU threads with multiple ORB extractor objects, as well as using a single orb-extractor feature object to handle multiple camera inputs.

The multithread feature provides more flexibility for Visual SLAM to call multiple objects of the orb-extractor feature library.

## Prerequisites

Complete the [Robot on Intel Getting Started Guide](../../../../gsg_robot/index.md) before continuing.

## Tutorial

> **Note:** This tutorial can be run both inside and outside a Docker image. It assumes that the `liborb-lze-dev` Deb package is installed and the user has copied the tutorial directory from `/opt/intel/orb_lze/samples/` to a user-writable directory.

1. Prepare the environment:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install liborb-lze-dev libgflags-dev
   cp -r /opt/intel/orb_lze/samples/ ~/orb_lze_samples
   cd ~/orb_lze_samples/
   ```

2. `main.cpp` should be in the directory. [View it on GitHub](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/release-2026.2.0/robotics-ai-suite/docs/robotics/sources/sample/main.cpp) to read the comments for the code.

3. Build the code:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ../
   make -j
   ```

4. Run the binary:

   ```bash
   ./feature_extract -h
   ```

   - Available command line arguments:

   ```text
   Usage: ./feature_extract --images=<> --image_path=<> --threads=<>

     --images <integer>     : Number of images or number of cameras. Default value: 1
     --image_path <string>  : Path to input image files. Default value: image.jpg
     --threads <integer>    : Number of threads to run. Default value: 1
     --iterations <integer> : Number of iterations to run. Default value: 10
   ```

   - The following command runs four threads, each thread taking two camera image inputs:

   ```bash
   ./feature_extract --images=2 --threads=4
   ```

5. Expected results example:

   ```text
   ./feature_extract --images=2 --threads=4
    iteration 10/10
    Thread:2: gpu host time=21.4233
    iteration 10/10
    Thread:1: gpu host time=21.133
    iteration 10/10
    Thread:4: gpu host time=20.9086
    iteration 10/10
    Thread:3: gpu host time=20.6155
   ```

   After execution, the input image displays keypoints as blue dots.

   > **Note:** You can specify the number of images per thread and the number of threads to execute. You can process multiple image inputs within a single thread of the extract API, or process one or more image inputs using multiple threads with extract API calls.
