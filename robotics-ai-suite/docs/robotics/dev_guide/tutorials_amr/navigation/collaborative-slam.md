### Collaborative Visual SLAM with Multi-Camera Feature

> **Note**: The following part illustrates part of the multi-camera feature in Collaborative SLAM that
> uses Kalman Filter to fuse SLAM poses from different trackers in a loosely-coupled manner,
> and we treat each individual camera as a separate tracker (ROS 2 node). For other parts of the multi-camera feature,
> they are not yet ready and will be integrated later.

1. To download and install the tutorial run the command below:

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ros-jazzy-cslam-tutorial-multi-camera
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ros-humble-cslam-tutorial-multi-camera
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

   > **Note**: In this installation package, there is a substantial ROS 2
   > bag file, which is approximately 206 MB in size.

2. Run the collaborative visual SLAM algorithm tracker frame-level pose fusion
   using Kalman Filter:

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   /opt/ros/jazzy/share/collab-slam/tutorial-multi-camera/cslam-multi-camera.sh
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   /opt/ros/humble/share/collab-slam/tutorial-multi-camera/cslam-multi-camera.sh
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

   **Expected result:** On the opened rviz windows, you see the pose trajectory
   outputs for each camera.

3. You may stop execution of the script any time by pressing CTRL-C.
   This tutorial demo is complete when the output to the console indicates that
   no further images are being processed.
   (hint: look for the output, "got 0 images in past 3.0s"). Press CTRL-C when
   you see this to stop the executing script.

   ```console
   [univloc_tracker_ros-1] [INFO] [1694539167.880197983] [univloc_tracker_0]: UnivLoc (unconnected) got 0 images in past 3.0s. Localized/processed 0/0 (0.00 Hz). Totally 2525/2525 (100.00%).
   ```

4. Afterwards, run the Python script to visualize the three trajectories
   obtained from ROS 2 topics: `univloc_tracker_0/kf_pose`, `univloc_tracker_2/kf_pose`, `/odometry/filtered`.

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   cd /tmp/
   python3 /opt/ros/jazzy/share/collab-slam/tutorial-multi-camera/traj-compare.py
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   cd /tmp/
   python3 /opt/ros/humble/share/collab-slam/tutorial-multi-camera/traj-compare.py
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

   Expected result: On the Python window, three trajectories are shown.
   An example image is as follows:

   - Blue indicates the trajectory generated by front camera.
   - Gray indicates the trajectory generated by rear camera.
   - Red indicates the fused trajectory generated by Kalman Filter.

   The trajectory from Kalman Filter should be the fused result of the other two trajectories
   indicating the multi-camera pose fusion is working properly.

   ![compare_trajectories](../../../images/compare_trajectories.png)

5. You may stop execution of the Python script any time by closing the chart window.

### Collaborative Visual SLAM with 2D Lidar Enabled

1. To download and install the tutorial run the command below:

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ros-jazzy-cslam-tutorial-2d-lidar
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ros-humble-cslam-tutorial-2d-lidar
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

   > **Note**: In this tutorial installation, there is a substantial ROS 2
   > bag file, which is approximately 3.7 GB in size.

2. Run the collaborative visual SLAM algorithm with auxiliary Lidar data input:

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   /opt/ros/jazzy/share/collab-slam/tutorial-2d-lidar/cslam-2d-lidar.sh
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   :::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   /opt/ros/humble/share/collab-slam/tutorial-2d-lidar/cslam-2d-lidar.sh
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

3. Use a separate terminal to debug and capture the output ROS 2 topic.
   You can check if certain topic has been published and view its messages.

   ```bash
   ros2 node list
   ros2 topic list
   ros2 topic echo /univloc_tracker_0/lidar_states
   ```

   Expected result: the values of `pose_failure_count` and `feature_failure_count` should not be 0,
   since they are the default values and should increase over time. On the opened rviz,
   you see the pose trajectory when Lidar data is used.

   ```console
   header:
   stamp:
      sec: 1
      nanosec: 683876706
   frame_id: ''
   feature_failure_count: 30
   pose_failure_count: 1
   ```

   ```bash
   /opt/ros/humble/share/collab-slam/tutorial-region-remap/cslam-region-remap.sh
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::
   ::::hide_directive-->

   **Expected result**: On the opened server rviz, you see the loaded pre-constructed keyframe/landmark map
   in mapping mode. Within the remapping region, corresponding map will be deleted.

   ![loaded_keyframes]( ../../../images/loaded_keyframes_and_landmarks_map.png)

   On the opened tracker rviz, initially you see the loaded 3D octree map.

## Collaborative Visual SLAM with GPU Offloading

With Intel GPU Level-Zero accelerated package for Collaborative SLAM installed,
it is possible to check GPU usage while a tutorial is actively executing.

- In a terminal, check how much of the GPU is using
  `intel-gpu-top`.

  ```bash
  # Ensure the package is installed
  sudo apt-get install intel-gpu-tools

  # The follow tool will then be available to execute
  sudo intel_gpu_top
  ```

  ![kudan_slam_gpu_top](../../../images/kudan_slam_gpu_top.png)

## Troubleshooting

- IMU functionality does not currently work properly for the AVX2 and GPU
  Level-Zero accelerated packages. Please use the SSE-only version of
  Collaborative SLAM for IMU.

- The odometry feature `use_odom:=true` does not work with these bags.

  The ROS 2 bags used in this example do not have the necessary topics recorded
  for the odometry feature of collaborative visual SLAM.

  If the `use_odom:=true` parameter is set, the `collab-slam` reports
  errors.

- For general robot issues, refer to
  [Troubleshooting](../robot-tutorials-troubleshooting.md).
