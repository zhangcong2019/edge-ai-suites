# ADBSCAN Algorithm

ADBSCAN (Adaptive DBSCAN) is an Intel® patented algorithm. It is a highly adaptive and scalable object detection and localization (clustering) algorithm, tested successfully to detect objects at all ranges for 2D Lidar, 3D Lidar, and Intel® RealSense™ Depth Camera.
This method automatically computes clustering parameters (radius and minimum number of points that define a cluster) based on the distance from the sensor and the data density in its field of view, thus alleviating the guesswork from parameter selection and enabling efficient hierarchical clustering.
ADBSCAN increases detection range by 30%-40% and detects 20%-30% more objects, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. It has been gainfully used in multiple applications such as 2D/3D Lidar or Intel® RealSense™ camera based object tracking, multi-modal object classification (Camera + Lidar), surface segmentation, Lidar-based object classification, occupancy grid generation etc.
