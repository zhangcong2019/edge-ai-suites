# OS Setup

To leverage all Embodied Intelligence SDK features, the target system should meet the [recommended system requirements](system_requirement.md). Also, the target system must have a compatible OS (`Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) or 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) Desktop` based on your processor type) so that you can install Deb packages from SDK. This section explains the procedure to install a compatible OS on the target system.

Do the following to prepare the target system:

1. Follow the [Ubuntu Installation Guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop) to install Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) or 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) Desktop with **64bits** variant on to the target system.

   > **Attention:**
   > Please review [Canonical Intellectual property rights policy](https://ubuntu.com/legal/intellectual-property-policy) regarding Canonical Ubuntu. Note that any redistribution of modified versions of Canonical Ubuntu must be approved, certified or provided by Canonical if you are going to associate it with the Trademarks. Otherwise you must remove and replace the Trademarks and will need to recompile the source code to create your own binaries.

2. To achieve real-time determinism and utilize the available Intel® silicon features, you need to configure certain BIOS settings. Reboot the target system and access the BIOS (press the `Delete` or `F2` keys while booting to open the BIOS menu).

3. Select **Restore Defaults** or **Load Defaults**, and then select **Save Changes and Reset**. As the target system boots, access the BIOS again.

4. Modify the BIOS configuration as listed in the following table.

   **Note**: The available configurations depend on the platform, BIOS in use, or both. Modify as many configurations as possible.

## Automated Setup Script

You can automate the software setup flow on this page with:

[os_setup_install.sh](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/release-2026.2.0/robotics-ai-suite/docs/embodied/get-started/prerequisites/os_setup_install.sh)

Default OS setup automation (locale + APT repositories):

```bash
sudo -E ./os_setup_install.sh
```

Set date/time during setup:

```bash
sudo -E ./os_setup_install.sh --set-date "2026-03-17 12:00"
```

Enable additional options:

```bash
sudo -E ./os_setup_install.sh --disable-auto-upgrades --fix-raw-github-host
```

For all available options:

```bash
./os_setup_install.sh --help
```

This script only automates software configuration. Ubuntu installation and BIOS setup remain manual.

If you prefer, you can skip this script and run the real-time setup script directly from the automated setup section of [Real-Time Linux](../installation/rt_linux.md).

## Set locale

Make sure you have a locale which supports `UTF-8`.
If you are in a minimal environment (such as a Docker container), the locale may be something minimal like `POSIX`.
Intel has tested it with the following settings. However, it should be fine if you are using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

## Set Date and Time

Use the `date` command to display the current date and time. If the Linux OS time and date is incorrect, set it to current date and time:

```bash
date
sudo date -s "2025-03-30 12:00"
```

## Setup Sources

This section explains the procedure to configure the APT package manager to use the hosted ECI APT repository.

## Set up ECI APT Repository

1. Open a terminal prompt which will be used to execute the remaining steps.

2. Download the ECI APT key to the system keyring:

   ```bash
   sudo -E wget -O- https://eci.intel.com/repos/gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-ECI.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/eci-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
   ```
   > **Note:** If error occur during download:
   >
   > ```bash
   > ERROR: cannot verify eci.intel.com's certificate, issued by ‘CN=Sectigo Public Server Authentication CA OV R36,O=Sectigo Limited,C=GB’:
   > Self-signed certificate encountered.
   > To connect to eci.intel.com insecurely, use `--no-check-certificate'.
   > ```
   > You can try the following command:
   >
   > ```bash
   > sudo apt install --only-upgrade ca-certificates 
   > ```

3. Add the signed entry to APT sources and configure the APT client to use the ECI APT repository:

   ```bash
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/eci-archive-keyring.gpg] https://eci.intel.com/repos/$(source /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) isar main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/eci.list
   echo "deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/eci-archive-keyring.gpg] https://eci.intel.com/repos/$(source /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) isar main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/eci.list
   ```

   **Note**: The auto upgrade feature in Canonical Ubuntu will change the deployment environment over time. If you do not want to auto upgrade, execute the following commands to disable the feature:

   ```bash
   sudo sed -i "s/APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\"/APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\"/g" "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades"
   sudo sed -i "s/APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\"/APT::Unattended-Upgrade \"0\"/g" "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades"
   sudo sed -i 's/APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1"/APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "0"/' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
   sudo sed -i 's/APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1"/APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0"/' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
   sudo sed -i 's/APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "1"/APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0"/' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
   ```
   Disables/hides the update notifier from automatically starting at login.
  
   ```bash
   echo "Hidden=true" | sudo tee -a /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop
   ```

4. Configure the ECI APT repository to have higher priority over other repositories:

   ```bash
   sudo bash -c 'echo -e "Package: *\nPin: origin eci.intel.com\nPin-Priority: 1000" >> /etc/apt/preferences.d/isar'
   sudo bash -c 'echo -e "Package: libze-intel-gpu1,libze1,intel-opencl-icd,libze-dev,intel-ocloc\nPin: origin repositories.intel.com/gpu/ubuntu\nPin-Priority: 1000" >> /etc/apt/preferences.d/isar'
   ```

## Set up ROS2 APT Repository

1. Ensure that the [Ubuntu Universe repository](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu) is enabled.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository -y universe
   ```

2. The [ros-apt-source](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros-apt-source/) packages provide keys and apt source configuration for the various ROS repositories.

   Installing the ros2-apt-source package will configure ROS 2 repositories for your system. Updates to repository configuration will occur automatically when new versions of this package are released to the ROS repositories.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
   export ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ros-infrastructure/ros-apt-source/releases/latest | grep -F "tag_name" | awk -F'"' '{print $4}')
   curl -L -o /tmp/ros2-apt-source.deb "https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros-apt-source/releases/download/${ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION}/ros2-apt-source_${ROS_APT_SOURCE_VERSION}.$(. /etc/os-release && echo ${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-${VERSION_CODENAME}})_all.deb"
   sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ros2-apt-source.deb
   ```
