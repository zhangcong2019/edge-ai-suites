# Imitation Learning - ACT

Imitation learning is a machine learning approach where a model is trained to mimic expert behavior by observing and replicating demonstrations, enabling it to perform tasks similarly to the expert. ACT is an action chunking policy with Transformers, an architecture designed for sequence modeling. It is trained as a conditional VAE (CVAE) to capture the variability in human data. It significantly outperforms previous imitation learning algorithms on a range of simulated and real-world fine manipulation tasks.

We have built an imitation learning pipeline for ACT, which can be used to train and evaluate the ACT model on different tasks both in simulation and real robot environment. In this sample pipeline, we provided source code optimized by OpenVINO™ to accelerate the process.

In this tutorial, we will introduce how to setup ACT pipeline.

## Source Code

The source code of this component can be found here: [ACT-Sample](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/tree/release-2026.2.0/robotics-ai-suite/pipelines/act-sample)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have completed the setup steps in [Get Started](../get_started.md).

## Installation

### ALOHA real robot environment setup (Optional)

Follow the [stationary ALOHA guide](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/aloha_docs/2.0/getting_started/stationary.html) to build real robot platform.

### Virtual environment setup

1. Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   python3 -m venv act
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

   ```bash
   source act/bin/activate
   ```

### Install OpenVINO™

Install the OpenVINO™ with the following command:

```bash
pip install openvino==2025.2.0
```

### Dependencies setup

Install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 pyquaternion==0.9.9 pyyaml==6.0 rospkg==1.5.0 pexpect==4.8.0 mujoco==3.2.6 dm_control==1.0.26 matplotlib==3.10.0 einops==0.6.0 packaging==23.0 h5py==3.12.1 ipython==8.12.0 opencv-python==4.10.0.84 transformers==4.37.0 accelerate==0.23.0 huggingface-hub==0.24.7
```

> **Note:** Usually, pip tries to download a pre-compiled wheel package so you don't have to build anything in this step. Maintainers may have not uploaded pre-compiled wheels for versions newer than the LTS version yet.
>
> Because of this, pip may fall back to building from source, which triggers the need for compilers and tools like Bazel. Additional build tools may be required to build some of the dependencies from source. If you encounter errors during installation, either switch to a different python version or check the error messages for missing tools or libraries and install them accordingly.

### Install ACT package

The Embodied Intelligence SDK provides optimized source code for OpenVINO™. To get the source code from `/opt/act-ov/` with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install act-ov
sudo chown -R $USER /opt/act-ov/
```

After installing the `act-ov` package, follow the `README.md` file in `/opt/act-ov/` to set up the complete source code environment.

### Install DETR

Install the DETR with the following command:

```bash
cd <act_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>/detr
pip install -e .
```

## Run pipeline

### Inference

1. You can download our pre-trained weights from this link: [Download Link](https://eci.intel.com/embodied-sdk-docs/_downloads/sim_insertion_scripted.zip). The command of training is the same as above, but you need to set the argument `--ckpt_dir` to the path of the pre-trained weights.

2. Convert the model checkpoint to OpenVINO IR.

   `ov_convert.py` is a script provided to convert the PyTorch model to OpenVINO IR. You can find the script in the `act-ov` directory, and see the usage with the following command:

   ```bash
   cd <act_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>
   python3 ov_convert.py -h
   ```

   For example, you can convert the model with the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 ov_convert.py --ckpt_path <your_ckpt_path> --height 480 --weight 640 --camera_num 4 --chunk_size 100
   ```

   > **Attention:** Please make sure the arguments `--chunk_size`, `--kl_weight`, `--hidden_dim`, `--dim_feedforward`, `--camera_num` are the same as the training arguments.

3. The pipeline supports configurations with up to four cameras. You can modify the `constants.py` file in the source directory to define the number of cameras. Below are examples of configurations for four cameras and one camera:

   ```python
   # In <act_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>/constants.py
   SIM_TASK_CONFIGS = {
       'sim_insertion_scripted': {
           'dataset_dir': DATA_DIR + '/sim_insertion_scripted',
           'num_episodes': 50,
           'episode_len': 400,
           'camera_names': ['top', 'angle', 'left_wrist', 'right_wrist']
       },
   }
   ```

   Below is a camera viewer showcasing four different camera perspectives, the left one is the `angle` camera, and the right one is the `top` camera. The middle two are the `left and right wrist` cameras, respectively.

4. Evaluate the policy with the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 imitate_episodes.py --task_name sim_insertion_scripted --ckpt_dir <ckpt dir> --policy_class ACT --kl_weight 10 --chunk_size 100 --hidden_dim 512 --batch_size 8 --dim_feedforward 3200 --num_epochs 2000  --lr 1e-5 --seed 0 --device GPU --eval
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > - `--eval` is used to evaluate the policy.
   > - `--device` is used to set the device to CPU or GPU.
   > - `--temporal_agg` can be used to enable the temporal aggregation algorithm.
   > - `--onscreen_render` can be used to enable onscreen rendering (requires python3-tk debian package install).
   > - `MUJOCO_GL=egl` environment variable can be set to enable EGL rendering, which provides better performance in simulation scenarios.

   If the script throws an `unrecognized arguments --device` error, then the updated ACT package has not been installed correctly. Ensure to run `pip install -e .` in the correct directory.

   When the `--onscreen_render` parameter is enabled, the successful inference result appears as follows:

   ```bash
   # Bimanual Insertion task
