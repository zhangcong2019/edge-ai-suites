# Install RVC

## Requirements

1. Docker Engine (Cannot be rootless, see [the installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/))

   - Docker version 20.10.0 or higher

2. Build Environment

   - Virtual Studio Code (VSCode) with Devcontainers extension (required)

## Clone the repository

To get started with the Robot Vision Control (RVC) project, you need to clone from the GitHub repository. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.2.0
```

Open the folder `robot-vision-control` in VSCode and follow the instructions to open it in a devcontainer.
This will automatically build a container with all the required dependencies to run RVC.
The container is based on Canonical Ubuntu OS 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).

## Build RVC image

Build the RVC Docker image outside of the devcontainer, after the devcontainer has been built. The Devcontainer provides the base container image for RVC.

```bash
cd robotics-ai-suite/robot-vision-control
./docker_build_rvc_img.sh
```

## Run RVC container

After building the RVC image, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
./docker_run_rvc_img.sh
```

This will start a container named `rvc` and open a bash terminal inside it. The container is configured to use the host GPU and camera.
