  Diagnose Content Search backend availability by probing the health endpoint,
  then surface connectivity issues between Flutter and backend when unhealthy.

  unreachable", "debug backend", or "check connectivity".

# SC Doctor

Find out whether the Smart Classroom RAG system is healthy and what's broken.
**Agent: execute every command below directly using your terminal tool and relay
the result.** If the backend is not up, hand off to [`sc-up`](../sc-up/SKILL.md).


Set `$BASE = "http://127.0.0.1:9011"` (or the value in `utils/flutter/assets/.env`).

---

## 1. Is the backend reachable?

```powershell
$BASE = "http://127.0.0.1:9011"
try {
    $r = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$BASE/api/v1/system/health" `
         -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
    Write-Host "Status: $($r.StatusCode)"
    $r.Content
} catch {
    Write-Host "UNREACHABLE — $($_.Exception.Message)"
}
```

- **`{"status":"ok"}`** → backend healthy, continue to step 2.
- **Connection refused / timeout** → nothing is running on port 9011. Use
  [`sc-up`](../sc-up/SKILL.md) to start the backend.
- **Non-200 status** → backend is running but unhealthy. Continue to step 3.

---

## 2. What services are reported by health?

A detailed health response includes per-service status. Parse it:

```powershell
$health = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$BASE/api/v1/system/health" -UseBasicParsing
$health.Content | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

Look for any service with `"status": "error"` or `"status": "degraded"`. Common
sub-services: vector store, LLM endpoint, object storage.

---

## 3. Is the Python venv intact?

The backend and Content Search share one venv (`smartclassroom/`).

```powershell
# venv exists?
Test-Path "smartclassroom\Scripts\python.exe"

# Python version
& "smartclassroom\Scripts\python.exe" --version

# Key packages installed?
& "smartclassroom\Scripts\pip.exe" list |
    Select-String "fastapi|llama-index|uvicorn|chromadb|faiss"
```

If packages are missing, run [`sc-setup`](../sc-setup/SKILL.md) to reinstall.

---

## 4. Backend process / port check

```powershell
# Is something listening on 9011?
netstat -ano | findstr ":9011"

# Which PID owns it?
Get-Process -Id (netstat -ano | findstr ":9011" |
    ForEach-Object { ($_ -split '\s+')[-1] } | Select-Object -First 1 |
    Where-Object { $_ -match '^\d+$' }) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
    Select-Object Id, Name, CPU
```

If port 9011 is occupied by a non-Python process, kill it and restart the backend.

---

## 5. Read backend logs

The backend logs to `smart-classroom/content_search/logs/`. Read recent lines:

```powershell
$logDir = "smart-classroom\content_search\logs"
if (Test-Path $logDir) {
    Get-ChildItem $logDir -Filter "*.log" |
        Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending |
        Select-Object -First 1 |
        ForEach-Object { Get-Content $_.FullName -Tail 80 }
} else {
    Write-Host "No log directory found at $logDir"
}
```

Look for lines containing `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `Traceback`, or `ImportError`.

---

## 6. Flutter SDK health

> `flutter --version` triggers a tool-cache build that downloads from pub.dev.

```powershell

# Flutter version (must be 3.22+)
flutter --version

# Run Flutter's own diagnostics
Push-Location utils\flutter
flutter doctor -v
Pop-Location
```

Look for `[✗]` entries — particularly missing Windows SDK, Visual Studio, or
Android/Chrome for web mode.

---

## 7. Check the .env config

```powershell
Get-Content "utils\flutter\assets\.env"
```

Verify `CONTENT_SEARCH_API_URL` matches the actual backend host:port. A mismatch
here causes "service unreachable" errors in the Flutter app even when the backend
is running.

---

## Common diagnoses

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Connection refused on port 9011 | Backend not started | Use `sc-up` |
| `{"status":"ok"}` but Flutter shows "unreachable" | `.env` URL mismatch | Fix `CONTENT_SEARCH_API_URL` in `.env`; hot-restart Flutter |
| Health returns 500 | Backend internal error | Read logs (step 5) |
| `fastapi`/`langchain` missing in venv | Incomplete setup | Run `sc-setup` |
| Port 9011 occupied by non-Python process | Stale process | Kill PID (step 4) and restart backend |
| `flutter doctor` shows `[✗] Windows` | Visual Studio / SDK missing | Install Visual Studio 2022 with "Desktop development with C++" workload |
| LLM service sub-health degraded | Model endpoint not configured | Check `smart-classroom/content_search/` config files for LLM URL/API key |

---

## Output

Summarize as: **backend reachable?** → **sub-services healthy?** → **venv
intact?** → **Flutter SDK OK?** → **recommended next step** (often a specific
`sc-up` or `sc-setup` invocation).
