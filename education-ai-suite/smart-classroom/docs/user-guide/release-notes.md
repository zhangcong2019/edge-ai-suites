# Release Notes: Smart Classroom

<!--## Version 2026.2-->

<!--date TBD-->

## Version 2026.1

**June 17, 2026**

Smart Classroom 2026.1, a modular, extensible framework for the Windows OS, adds a Content Search subsystem, document upload, text/image retrieval,
OCR, QnA, and multilingual processing including Mandarin/Chinese. This release also adds
WebRTC WHEP streaming, Intel Wildcat Lake platform support, and updates to audio transcription.

**New**

- **Content Search module** for uploading documents and media, indexing them with
  OpenVINO-accelerated embedding models, and retrieving results by text or image query.
- **Q&A support** in Content Search for querying uploaded content with locally running LLMs.
- **OCR** in Content Search with OpenVINO and PaddleOCR for printed and handwritten documents.
- **Mandarin/Chinese language support** for QnA and transcription pipelines.
- **File listing and file removal endpoints** in the Content Search API.
- **Config API endpoint** in Content Search for runtime search and embedding settings.
- **WebRTC WHEP streaming** for low-latency live video delivery.
- **Intel(R) Core(TM) Series 3** (Wildcat Lake) processor support.
- **Video start and end timestamps** in Content Search results for precise navigation.
- **Resource utilization monitoring** to cap pipeline resource usage.

**Improved**

- Long audio transcription is now supported with and without speaker diarization.
- RTSP playback mode and file duration validation in the video ingestion pipeline.
- Content Search embedding models upgraded to multilingual and cross-lingual models.
- Batch embedding insertion for improved indexing throughput on large document sets.
- Local PyAnnote audio model caching for offline diarization loading.
- Pipeline startup reliability under concurrent load.
- YOLO model configuration and quantization setting updates.
- CMake configuration and build scripts for the gvasmartclassroom GStreamer plugin.
- Error tracking for pipeline status reporting.
- Video summarization output consistency.
- UI behavior to stop active streaming sessions automatically after 10 minutes.
- Support for DL Streamer 2026.1.
- Summary scoring formula updates and reranker configuration refactoring.
- Content Search download streaming optimization to reduce memory overhead for large file
  transfers.

**Fixed**

- Crash in the video analytics pipeline.
- Noise in per-class attendance statistics in the video pipeline.
- Content Search cleanup when no task ID was present.
- Duplicate file entries caused by missing task IDs during upload.
- Inference request conflicts when embedding multiple documents concurrently.
- Incorrect video scaling in the HLS player at some resolutions.
- Encoding errors in video analytics output.
- Incorrect YOLO model quantization results.
- Content Search upload and delete operations under some conditions.
- Corrupted file handling in Content Search that could cause indexing failures.
- Hardcoded model name in the startup script; model name is now read from configuration.

## Version 2026.0

**April 1, 2026**

The Smart Classroom application now offers a series after-class summary enhancements in the form of next‑generation real-time audio and visual analytics, giving teachers and schools a better understanding of classroom dynamics through AI‑driven summaries and engagement metrics.

The Education AI Suite now also includes built-in telemetry hooks and benchmarking.

**New**

- **Speaker Diarization** (via the Audio Pipeline):
  - identifies teacher and student speakers using NPU-accelerated diarization
  - generates an interactive audio timeline for replay and analysis
  - enables time-coded navigation within class video recordings

- **Class Engagement Metrics – Audio**:
  - measure teacher and student speech duration
  - track questions asked and answered
  - track student-teacher interaction frequency

- **Class Engagement Metrics – Video**:
  - track student hand raises
  - track posture changes (stand up/sit down)
  - track teacher movement

- **Built‑in telemetry** to measure classroom workloads across Intel platforms (CPU core utilization, iGPU load, NPU load, memory usage, workload-specific performance counters)

- **Benchmarking scripts** to reproduce Intel internal performance measurements, and validate XPU performance

**Improved**

- **Knowledge Graph UI** readability and formatting, and increased clarity when visualizing topic relationships
