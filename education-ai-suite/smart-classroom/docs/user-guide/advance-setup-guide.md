# Get Started

This guide walks you through installing dependencies, configuring defaults, and running the application.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

To install dependencies, do the following:

### A. Install FFmpeg (required for audio processing)

Download from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and add the `ffmpeg/bin` folder to your system `PATH`.

### B. Install DL Streamer

Download the installer from [DL Streamer assets on GitHub](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/dlstreamer/releases).
For details, refer to the [Install Guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/install/install_guide_windows.html).

> Note: DL Streamer 2026.1.0 is lastest verified version, please also update your [NPU driver](./get-started/system-requirements.md#software-and-hardware-requirements) to latest for compatability.

**Run your shell with admin privileges before starting the application**

### C. Clone Repository

Go to the target directory of your choice and clone the suite.
If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `main` with the desired tag, for example: `release-2026.2.0`.
To learn more on partial cloning, check the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

```bash
  git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch release-2026.2.0 https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
  cd edge-ai-suites
  git sparse-checkout set education-ai-suite
  cd education-ai-suite
```

### D. Install Python dependencies

It’s recommended to create a **dedicated Python virtual environment** for the base dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv smartclassroom
smartclassroom\Scripts\activate

# Use Python 3.12.x before running pip.
cd smart-classroom
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### E. Install LibreOffice (optional, feature-dependent)

LibreOffice (the `soffice` executable) is an **optional** dependency used by two features. Install it only if you enable a feature that needs it:

- **`report` — PDF report export:** The class report is generated as a `.docx` file. When you download it as **PDF**, the server converts the `.docx` using LibreOffice in headless mode (`soffice --convert-to pdf`). If LibreOffice is **not** installed, `.docx` download still works normally and only the PDF download returns `501 (PDF export unavailable)`.
- **`content_search` — legacy document parsing:** Ingesting legacy Office formats (`.doc`, `.ppt`, `.xls`) requires LibreOffice to convert them. Modern formats (`.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`) do not need it. If LibreOffice is missing, uploading a legacy format is rejected with a message asking you to install it or convert to a modern format.

If you enable either use case, download and install LibreOffice from [https://www.libreoffice.org/download/](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/), then make sure the `soffice` executable is available on your system `PATH`.

Verify the executable is discoverable:

```python
import shutil
shutil.which("soffice") is not None   # should return True
```

## Step 2: Configuration

### A. Enable Feature Configuration

The application is built using a modular feature architecture, allowing users to enable or disable individual features through the `features:` block in `smart-classroom/config.yaml`. Only enabled features are initialized at startup—they load their required models, register their API routes, and start their associated services.

```yaml
features:
  asr:                { enabled: true }   # Speech-to-text transcription
  summary:            { enabled: true }   # AI class summary / report
  mindmap:            { enabled: true }   # Mind map generation
  topic_segmentation: { enabled: true }
  video_analytics:    { enabled: true }   # Video ingestion / analytics
  board_ocr:          { enabled: true }   # OCR of the teacher's display (IFPD)
  content_search:     { enabled: true }   # Multimodal search + RAG service (port 9011)
  qa:                 { enabled: true }   # RAG-based Q&A over uploaded materials
```

**Important: After updating the configuration, reload the application for changes to take effect.**

### B. Default Configuration

By default, the project uses Whisper for transcription and OpenVINO-based Qwen models for summarization.You can modify these settings in the configuration file (`smart-classroom/config.yaml`):

```yaml
asr:
  provider: openai            # Supported: openvino, openai, funasr
  name: whisper-small          # Options: whisper-tiny, whisper-small, paraformer-zh etc.
  device: CPU                 # Whisper currently supports only CPU
  temperature: 0.0

summarizer:
  provider: openvino
  name: Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct # Examples: Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat, Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
  device: GPU                 # Options: GPU or CPU
  weight_format: int8         # Supported: fp16, fp32, int4, int8
  max_new_tokens: 1024        # Maximum tokens to generate in summaries
```

### C. Chinese Audio Transcription

For Chinese audio transcription, switch to funASR with Paraformer in your config (`smart-classroom/config.yaml`):

```yaml
asr:
  provider: funasr
  name: paraformer-zh
```
Please also set the language to Chinese at the app level:

```yaml
app:
  language: zh
```

### D. Content Search Configuration

**Upload Size Limits** can be adjusted under the `content_search` section:

```yaml
content_search:
  storage:
    document_max_mb: 100    # maximum upload size for documents (MB)
    video_max_mb: 1024      # maximum upload size for videos (MB)
```

**Document OCR** To also extract text from images embedded in uploaded documents, turn on OCR for content search:

```yaml
content_search:
  ocr_enabled: true
```

> **Note:** This only affects document ingestion. Board OCR has its own OCR usage and is unaffected by this flag.

### E. Board OCR Configuration

Board OCR extracts text from the teacher's interactive display (IFPD) during a session, feeding the board summary and class report. It has below configurations:

```yaml
board_ocr:
  frame_rate: "1/3"    # frames per second sampled from the board video
  debug: false         # keep the uncleaned board_ocr_raw.txt alongside the output
```

> **Note:** When Board OCR is enabled, the AI-generated class summary automatically gains an extra **"Board / IFPD Content"** section that summarizes the text captured from the display, in addition to the sections derived from the audio transcript.

### F. Speaker Diarization Setup (Optional)

Speaker diarization is supported using Pyannote Audio models.
To enable diarization, you must request access to the Pyannote pretrained models and provide a Hugging Face access token.

#### a. Request Model Access on Hugging Face

Pyannote diarization models require gated access.

Request access here:

[Pyannote Speaker Diarization Community v1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1)

Click "Request Access" on the model page and wait for approval.

#### b. Create a Hugging Face Access Token

After approval:

Go to the [Hugging Face Access Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) page.

Create a Read access token

Copy the generated token

#### c. Configure Hugging Face Token in Project Config

Open `smart-classroom/config.yaml` and set `diarization: true` under `models.asr`, then add your Hugging Face token:

```yaml
models:
  asr:
    diarization: true
    hf_token: "hf_your_access_token_here"
```

> **Note:** The diarization model downloads automatically on next startup once `diarization: true` is set.

**Important: After updating the configuration, reload the application for changes to take effect.**

## Step 3: Run the Application

Run the backend:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see backend logs similar to this:

```text
pipeline initialized
[INFO] __main__: App started, Starting Server...
INFO:     Started server process [21616]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This means your pipeline server has started successfully and is ready to accept requests.

## Step 4: Set Up Content Search

Content Search provides multimodal semantic search, AI-driven video summarization, and RAG-based Q&A over uploaded educational materials.

### A. Content Search Dependencies

Content Search runs in the same `smartclassroom` environment as the backend.

> **Note:**  When the `content_search` feature is enabled in `config.yaml`, the backend (`main.py`) automatically launches the Content Search services on startup and shuts them down when it exits.

When all services are ready:

```
[launcher] All 5 services are ready. (startup took XXs)
[launcher] You can use Ctrl+C to stop all services.
```

Verify the service status:

```PowerShell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:9011/api/v1/system/health"
```

> **Note:** First-time execution may take several minutes as AI models (CLIP, BGE, Qwen VLM) are downloaded.

### B. Network Requirements for Content Search

- **Proxy**: If behind a proxy, ensure `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables are configured.
- **Model Downloads**: Stable access to `huggingface.co` is required for downloading pre-trained models.
- **Windows Long Paths**: Move the project to a shallow directory (e.g., `C:\User\CS`) or enable long paths:

  ```PowerShell
  New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" `
  -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
  ```

## Step 5: Set Up Grading (Optional)

> **Note:** Skip this step if `grading.enabled: false` in `config.yaml`.

Smart Grading uses a layout detection model that requires a one-time conversion from Paddle format to OpenVINO IR. This step creates a dedicated conversion environment.

### A. Create the Model Conversion Environment

```PowerShell
cd smart-classroom\components\grading\providers\layout_detection_service
python -m venv venv_convert
.\venv_convert\Scripts\pip install -r requirements_convert.txt
```

### B. Convert and Download the Layout Detection Model

```PowerShell
.\venv_convert\Scripts\python ensure_layout_model.py
```

> **Note:** This downloads PP-DocLayoutV2 (~200 MB) and converts it to OpenVINO IR. Subsequent runs detect the existing model and skip this step automatically.

### C. Launch Grading Services

Open two new terminal windows (the Backend terminal must remain running):

**Terminal — Layout Detection (port 9902):**
```PowerShell
cd smart-classroom\components\grading\providers
python .\layout_detection_service\layout_detection_server.py
```

**Terminal — Grading Service (port 9012):**
```PowerShell
cd smart-classroom\components\grading
python grading_service.py
```

## Step 6: Bring Up the Frontend

> **Note:** Open a new Command Prompt / terminal window for the frontend.
> The backend and Content Search terminals stay busy serving requests.

```bash
cd <path-to>\edge-ai-suites\education-ai-suite\smart-classroom\ui
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

### Optional: Run as an Electron Desktop App

The UI can run as a Windows desktop app instead of a browser tab.
This is an additive layer: it connects to the same backend services,
so those must be running as in the previous steps.

```bash
cd <path-to>\edge-ai-suites\education-ai-suite\smart-classroom\ui
npm install

# Development: opens the desktop window and starts the dev server on 5173
npm run electron:dev

# Production preview: builds the UI and runs the packaged launch path, no dev server.
npm run electron:preview

# Package a standalone Windows portable executable:
#   release\SmartClassroom-<version>-portable.exe
npm run electron:build
```

> **Note** The Electron runtime binary is fetched lazily the **first time Electron runs**
> (`npm run electron:dev` / `electron:preview`). Behind a proxy, the first launch
> needs the proxy variables `ELECTRON_GET_USE_PROXY=true` and
> `GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTPS_PROXY=<proxy>` in addition to the usual
> `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY`. The `npm run electron:build` downloads
> its own copy via electron-builder and honors the standard `HTTPS_PROXY`.

## Step 6: Access the UI

After starting the frontend you can open the Smart Classroom UI in a browser
(or, if you used `npm run electron:dev`, in the Electron desktop window
that opens automatically):

Local machine:

- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

From another device on the same network (replace <HOST_IP> with your computer’s IP):

- `http://<HOST_IP>:5173`

Find your IP (Windows PowerShell):

```sh
ipconfig
```

Use the IPv4 Address from your active network adapter.

If you changed the port, adjust the URL accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Frontend not opening:**
  Ensure you ran `npm run dev` in a second terminal after starting `python main.py`.

- **Backend not ready:**
  Wait until Uvicorn shows **"Application startup complete"** and is listening on port **8000**.

- **URL fails from another device:**
  Confirm you used `--host 0.0.0.0` and replaced `<HOST_IP>` correctly.

- **Nothing at http://localhost:5173:**
  Check that the frontend terminal shows the Vite server running and no port conflict.

- **Firewall blocks access:**
  Allow inbound traffic on ports **5173** (frontend) and **8000** (backend) on Windows.

- **Auto reload not happening:**
  Refresh manually if the backend was restarted after initial UI load.

- **Error: `Port for tensor name cache_position was not found.`**
  This means the models were not configured correctly.
  To fix this:

  1. Delete the models directory:

     ```text
     edge-ai-suites/education-ai-suite/smart-classroom/models
     ```

  2. Rerun only Step 1, option D. If the virtual environment already exists, rerun the required pip commands.

- **Application crash during bring-up on Intel® Core™ Ultra Series 3 and Intel® Core™ Series 3 (WCL) processors without any error indication:** Sometimes OpenVINO GenAI models may crash on newer hardware. Try setting `use_ov_genai: False` in `config.yaml`.

- **Tokenizer load issue:**

  If you see this error:

  ```bash
  Either openvino_tokenizer.xml was not provided or it was not loaded correctly. Tokenizer::encode is not available
  ```

  Delete the models folder from `edge-ai-suites/education-ai-suite/smart-classroom/models` and try again.

- If you see below error while running dls setup script,

  ```text
  .\setup_dls_env.ps1
    CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
  ```

  Run the command:

  ```bash
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
  ```

- **Error: `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES`** during summarization of longer audio inputs
  Summarization of longer transcripts may require additional GPU memory. If this error occurs, increase the GPU memory allocation in the **Intel® Graphics Software** application under the **Graphics** tab before rerunning the workflow.
  ![GPU Troubleshooting](./_assets/troubleshooting-gpu.png)

### Known Issues

- **Manual Video File Path Input**: In web browser, users are required to manually specify the path to video files from their local system in the base directory input. It is recommended to use Electron desktop app for seamless operation.
- **Live Video Monitoring Timeout**: Live video monitoring sessions will automatically stop after 45 minutes if the user does not reload the page to start a new session.
- **Stream End Notification**: Once the video streaming ends, the user will see a "Stream not found" message on the screen, indicating that the stream has concluded.
- **Do Not Reload During Active Streaming**: Users should not reload the page while the stream is active. Reloading the page will terminate the session, and the user will lose the current stream. Wait until the "Stream not found" notification appears on the screen before reloading.
- **Video Ready Notification**: If the URL is configured in the settings, the notification will display "Video Ready" unless the screen is reloaded. Reloading the screen will reset the session and the notification.
