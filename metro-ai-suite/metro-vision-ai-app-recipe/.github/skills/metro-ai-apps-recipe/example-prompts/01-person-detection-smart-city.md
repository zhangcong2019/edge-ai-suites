# Person-counting stack for a smart-city camera feed

Build a full end-to-end computer-vision analytics stack in `./person-detect-stack/`
using the metro-ai-apps-recipe. Vertical: smart city. Object of interest:
`person`. Use a YOLO-family person detector on CPU, four looping sample-video
sources, and a Node-RED rule that alerts when `count>2 in 10s` per source.
Publish detections to `object_detection_N/<pipeline>`, alerts to
`alerts/person`, and a scalar count to `stats/person_count`. Stream the
annotated video over WebRTC (DLSPS WHIP → MediaMTX, Coturn for ICE/TURN) and
embed the WHEP player as Grafana `<iframe>` panels. Produce the DLSPS config,
Mosquitto, Node-RED flow, Nginx TLS proxy (WHEP/WHIP + WebRTC-TCP), Grafana
dashboard, and pytest suite, then verify against the completion criteria.
