# AI Crowd Analytics through Vibe Coding

This tutorial walks you through leveraging an existing Metro Vision AI App Recipe-powered application
and turning it into a 'new application' by 'vibe coding', all while the underlying application architecture remains the same.

## Metro Vision AI App Recipe Architecture

![Metro Vision AI App Recipe Architecture](./_images/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe-architecture.drawio.svg "metro vision ai app recipe architecture")

### Key Features of this architecture

- **Vision Analytics Pipeline:** Detect and classify objects using pre-configured AI models. Customize parameters such as thresholds and object types without requiring additional coding.
- **Integration with MQTT, Node-RED, and Grafana:** Facilitates efficient message handling, real-time monitoring and business logic integration, and insightful data visualization.
- **User-Friendly:** Simplifies configuration and operation through prebuilt scripts and configuration files.

### Key Components of this architecture

- **DL Streamer Pipeline Server:** Processes video frames, extracts metadata, and integrates AI inference results. It runs the Vision Analytics Pipeline mentioned above
- **Mosquitto MQTT Broker:** Facilitates message communication between components like Node-RED and DL Streamer Pipeline Server using the MQTT protocol.
- **Node-RED:** A low-code platform for setting up application-specific rules, running application business logic and triggering MQTT-based events.
- **Grafana Dashboard:** Serves as application UI. A monitoring and visualization tool for analyzing pipeline metrics, logs, and other performance data.

This architecture is capable of building any typical Vision AI sample application with minimal effort.

## How to leverage an existing 'Metro Vision AI App Recipe powered application' and turn it into a 'new application' by 'vibe coding'

The below aspects need to be updated accordingly, in order to leverage an existing Metro Vision AI App Recipe-powered application and turn it into a 'new application' by 'vibe coding':

- **AI model:** This is the new AI model that serves the inference purposes of the new application.
- **Video file:** This is the new video source that serves as input to the new application.
- **Vision Analytics Pipeline:** This is the AI processing DL Streamer pipeline that needs to be modified appropriately, considering the new AI model and new video source input.
- **Node-RED Business Logic:** This is the business logic that runs on the vision analytics pipeline output. This decides what post-processing happens on the vision analytics pipeline output, the result of which is provided as insights in the Grafana dashboard. This is where 'vibe coding' comes into play. We will interact with Claude Sonnet 4.5 in the GitHub Copilot offering.
- **Configuration updates:** This is the application configuration such as self signed certificates, Docker Compose, Node-RED, Grafana, etc.

Note: The underlying application architecture remains the same.

## Build a new application: 'AI Crowd Analytics'

Now let us get started with building a new 'AI Crowd Analytics' application that automatically detects vehicles and identifies whether they form a "crowd" (closely grouped vehicles) or are scattered individually. The system leverages Intel's Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer) framework with pre-trained AI models to process video streams and analyze vehicle clustering patterns in real-time.

We will use the [Smart Parking](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-suites/smart-parking/index.html) application as the existing Metro Vision AI App Recipe-powered application and turn it into an 'AI Crowd Analytics' application.

### 1. **Create the Crowd Analytics Application Directory**

Navigate to the metro vision AI recipe directory and create the crowd-analytics application by copying the Smart Parking template:

```bash
cd ./edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe
cp -r smart-parking/ crowd-analytics/
```

### 2. **Download Sample Video File**

```bash
mkdir -p ./crowd-analytics/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/videos/
wget -O ./crowd-analytics/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/videos/easy1.mp4 \
  https://github.com/freedomwebtech/yolov8-advance-parkingspace-detection/raw/main/easy1.mp4
```

<details>
<summary>
Video File Details
</summary>

The sample video contains:

- Multiple vehicles in various parking scenarios
- Examples of both clustered (crowded) and scattered vehicle arrangements
- Duration: Approximately 21 seconds of footage

</details>

### 3. **Download and Setup AI Models**

```bash
docker run --rm --user=root \
  -e http_proxy -e https_proxy -e no_proxy \
  -v "$PWD:/home/dlstreamer/metro-suite" \
  intel/dlstreamer:2026.2.0-ubuntu24-rc1 bash -c "$(cat <<EOF

cd /home/dlstreamer/metro-suite/

mkdir -p crowd-analytics/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/models/public
export MODELS_PATH=/home/dlstreamer/metro-suite/crowd-analytics/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/models
/home/open-edge-platform/dlstreamer/samples/download_public_models.sh yolo11s coco128

echo "Fix ownership..."
chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -g)" crowd-analytics/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/models crowd-analytics/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/videos 2>/dev/null || true
EOF
)"
```

The installation script downloads and sets up essential AI models:

| **Model Name** | **Purpose**                        | **Framework**     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| YOLO11s        | Vehicle detection and localization | PyTorch/OpenVINO™ |

### 4. **Configure the AI Processing Pipeline**

Update the pipeline configuration to use the crowd analytics AI models. Create or update the configuration file:

```bash
cat > ./crowd-analytics/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/config.json << 'EOF'
{
    "config": {
        "pipelines": [
            {
                "name": "yolov11s_crowd_analytics",
                "source": "gstreamer",
                "queue_maxsize": 50,
                "pipeline": "{auto_source} name=source ! decodebin ! gvaattachroi roi=1000,550,1800,800 ! gvadetect model=/home/pipeline-server/models/public/yolo11s/FP16/yolo11s.xml device=CPU pre-process-backend=opencv name=detection inference-region=1 ! queue ! gvatrack tracking-type=short-term-imageless ! queue ! gvametaconvert add-empty-results=true name=metaconvert ! gvametapublish file-format=2 file-path=/tmp/easy1_test1.jsonl ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! appsink name=destination",
                "description": "Vehicle detection and tracking for crowd analytics",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "detection-properties": {
                            "element": {
                                "name": "detection",
                                "format": "element-properties"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                },
                "auto_start": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
EOF
```

<details>
<summary>
Pipeline Configuration Explanation
</summary>
The GStreamer pipeline configuration defines the crowd analytics AI processing workflow:

- **Source**: Accepts video input from parking lot video file
- **Decode**: Converts video format to raw frames for processing
- **gvaattachroi**: Defines a region of interest (ROI) with coordinates thus improving performance by processing only the relevant portion of the frame
- **gvadetect**: Runs the YOLO11s object detection model (FP16 optimized) on CPU to identify and locate vehicles in each frame
- **gvatrack**: Tracks detected vehicles across frames using imageless tracking, assigning persistent IDs to each vehicle without storing frame images
- **gvametaconvert**: Converts inference results to structured metadata with vehicle positions
- **gvafpscounter**: Monitors processing performance

</details>

### 5. **Configure Application Environment**

Update the environment configuration to use the Crowd Analytics application and create self-signed certificates for nginx:

```bash
# Update the .env file to specify the crowd-analytics application and HOST IP Address
sed -i 's/^SAMPLE_APP=.*/SAMPLE_APP=crowd-analytics/' .env
sed -i "s/^HOST_IP=.*/HOST_IP=$(hostname -I | cut -f1 -d' ')/" .env


# Create self signed certificate for nginx
mkdir -p crowd-analytics/src/nginx/ssl
cd crowd-analytics/src/nginx/ssl
if [ ! -f server.key ] || [ ! -f server.crt ]; then
    echo "Generate self-signed certificate..."
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=San Francisco/O=Intel/OU=Edge AI/CN=localhost"
    chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -g)" server.key server.crt 2>/dev/null || true

fi
cd ../../../../

# Verify the configuration
grep SAMPLE_APP= .env
grep HOST_IP= .env
```

### 6. **Deploy the Application**

Set up the Docker Compose configuration and start the application:

```bash
# Copy the compose file for deployment
cp compose-without-scenescape.yml docker-compose.yml

# Start all services in detached mode
docker compose up -d
```

### 7. **Customize Node-RED Business Logic**

The following steps guide you through customizing Node-RED flows to implement crowd analytics logic for vehicle detection data. You will learn how to connect to MQTT data streams from the crowd analytics pipeline, calculate vehicle proximities using Euclidean distances, detect crowd formations (clusters of vehicles in close proximity), and create enhanced analytics outputs.

#### 7.1 **Business Logic Overview**

The custom Node-RED flow implements crowd detection algorithms:

- **MQTT Input Node**: Subscribes to vehicle detection data from YOLO11s pipeline
- **Vehicle Position Extractor**: Parses bounding box coordinates (x, y, w, h format) to calculate centroids.
- **Hotspot Detector**: Computes Euclidean distances between all vehicle pairs. Applies proximity thresholds to identify crowd formations (2+ vehicles in close proximity)
- **Hotspot Analytics Generator**: Creates crowd metrics, density maps, crowd length measurements, and alerts
- **MQTT Output Node**: Publishes crowd analytics data to visualization systems

#### 7.2 **Vibe coding with Claude Sonnet 4.5**

In order to achieve the above business logic, we performed vibe coding with Claude Sonnet 4.5 that is available as a part of GitHub Copilot integration with VSCode.

Essentially, we put ourselves in the shoes of an architect, and put Copilot in the shoes of a developer. Then we describe our architecture to Copilot and ask it to generate code to achieve individual components within that architecture.

In this context, our architecture consists of below 3 functions/components as detailed above:

- **Vehicle Position Extractor**
- **Hotspot Detector**
- **Hotspot Analytics Generator**

Here are the example prompts that we used:

- **Prompt for Vehicle Position Extractor**: The code output from Copilot after vibe coding with this prompt is used in step [#7.7](#77-implement-vehicle-position-extraction-function) below

  ```text
  Here is the metadata output from DL Streamer Pipeline Server (Video Analytics pipeline) that does object detection.
  [PASTE METADATA HERE].
  Provide a Node-RED function that parses bounding box coordinates (x, y, w, h format) to calculate centroids, only include objects that are vehicles and return output message with vehicle positions.
  ```

  > **Note:** After completing step [#7.6](#76-add-debug-output-for-vehicle-data-monitoring) and starting the pipeline using the curl command, open the Node-RED debug panel on the right (bug icon). Select the Vehicle Data Monitor debug node from the drop down in the debug panel to view the metadata, which is used in the prompt to generate Extract Vehicle Positions.

![Crowd Analytics Node-RED Debug Panel](_images/crowd-analytics-debug-panel.png "crowd analytics node-red debug panel")

- **Prompt for Hotspot Detector**: The code output from Copilot after vibe coding with this prompt is used in step [#7.8](#78-implement-hotspot-detection-algorithm) below

  ```text
  - Based on the output of the previous function node, compute hotspots of vehicles. Include configurable parameters for the below in the code:
    - Maximum distance (pixels) to consider vehicles part of same hotspot
    - Distance calculation method: "euclidean", "manhattan", "horizontal", "vertical", etc.,
    - Minimum number of parked vehicles to form a hotspot
    - Maximum movement (pixels) to consider a vehicle stationary
    - Frames vehicle must stay stationary to be marked as parked
  ```

- **Prompt for Hotspot Analytics Generator**: The code output from co-pilot after vibe coding with this prompt is used in step [#7.9](#79-add-hotspot-analytics-output-processing) below

  ```text
  - Based on the output of the previous function node, generate a table-friendly output with one row per hotspot that can be displayed on a Grafana dashboard. Ensure that each hotspot becomes a separate MQTT message for proper Grafana table visualization
  ```

> **Note:** The exact output for the above prompts from Copilot was not used as is. It involved more 'prompt engineering' and 'fine tuning' along with setting the correct default configurable options in the code as a part of vibe coding with Copilot to achieve the code that best suits our use case.

#### 7.3 **Access the Node-RED Interface**

Open your web browser and navigate to the Node-RED interface:

```
https://<HOST_IP>/nodered/
```

Replace `<HOST_IP>` with your actual system IP address.

#### 7.4 **Clear Existing Node-RED Flows**

Remove any existing flows to start with a clean workspace:

1. **Select All Flows**: Press `Ctrl+A` (or `Cmd+A` on Mac) to select all nodes in the current flow
2. **Delete Selected Nodes**: Press the `Delete` key to remove all selected nodes
3. **Deploy Changes**: Click the red **Deploy** button in the top-right corner to save the changes

#### 7.5 **Create MQTT Input Connection for Vehicle Data**

Set up an MQTT subscriber node to receive vehicle detection data:

1. **Add MQTT Input Node**:
   - Drag an `mqtt in` node from the **network** section in the left palette
   - Double-click the node to configure it

2. **Configure MQTT Broker**:
   - **Server**: `broker:1883` (or your MQTT broker address)
   - **Topic**: `object_detection_1` (crowd analytics data topic)
   - **QoS**: `0`
   - **Output**: `auto-detect (string or buffer)`

3. **Set Node Properties**:
   - **Name**: `Vehicle Detection Input`
   - Click **Done** to save the configuration

#### 7.6 **Add Debug Output for Vehicle Data Monitoring**

Create a debug node to monitor incoming vehicle detection data:

1. **Add Debug Node**:
   - Drag a `debug` node from the **common** section
   - Connect the output of the MQTT input node to the debug node input

2. **Configure Debug Node**:
   - **Output**: `msg.payload`
   - **To**: `debug tab and console`
   - **Name**: `Vehicle Data Monitor`

3. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Click **Deploy**
   - Check the debug panel (bug icon in the right sidebar) for incoming vehicle detection messages
   - The debug messages from this node is being used to generate the code for extracting vehicle positions in step [#7.7](#77-implement-vehicle-position-extraction-function) using prompt engineering.

#### 7.7 **Implement Vehicle Position Extraction Function**

Add a function node to extract vehicle positions from detection data:

1. **Add Function Node**:
   - Drag a `function` node from the **function** section
   - Position it after the MQTT input node

2. **Configure the Vehicle Position Extractor**:
   - **Name**: `Extract Vehicle Positions`
   - **Function Code**:

     ```javascript
     // Extract vehicle positions from YOLOv11s detection data
     // Calculate centroid coordinates for each detected vehicle

     // Parse JSON if payload is a string
     if (typeof msg.payload === "string") {
       try {
         msg.payload = JSON.parse(msg.payload);
       } catch (e) {
         node.warn("Failed to parse JSON: " + e.message);
         return null;
       }
     }

     // Check if payload exists and has metadata.objects array
     if (
       !msg.payload ||
       !msg.payload.metadata ||
       !msg.payload.metadata.objects ||
       !Array.isArray(msg.payload.metadata.objects)
     ) {
       return null; // Ignore frames without vehicle data
     }

     let vehicles = [];
     let frameTimestamp = Date.now();
     let metadata = msg.payload.metadata;

     // Get frame dimensions for calculations
     let frameWidth = metadata.width || 1920;
     let frameHeight = metadata.height || 1080;

     // Process each detected object
     for (let i = 0; i < metadata.objects.length; i++) {
       let obj = metadata.objects[i];

       // Filter for cars only (you can add more vehicle types if needed)
       let vehicleTypes = ["car", "truck", "bus", "motorcycle", "vehicle"];
       if (
         !obj.detection ||
         !obj.detection.label ||
         !vehicleTypes.includes(obj.detection.label.toLowerCase())
       ) {
         continue; // Skip non-vehicle objects
       }

       // Extract bounding box coordinates (x, y, w, h format)
       let x = obj.x || 0;
       let y = obj.y || 0;
       let w = obj.w || 0;
       let h = obj.h || 0;

       if (w === 0 || h === 0) {
         continue; // Skip objects without valid dimensions
       }

       // Calculate centroid coordinates (center of bounding box)
       let centerX = x + w / 2;
       let centerY = y + h / 2;

       // Calculate bounding box area
       let area = w * h;

       // Get normalized coordinates from detection bounding_box
       let bbox = obj.detection.bounding_box || {};

       // Create vehicle object
       let vehicle = {
         id: obj.id || `vehicle_${i}`,
         type: obj.detection.label,
         confidence: obj.detection.confidence || 0,
         position: {
           x: centerX, // Pixel coordinates
           y: centerY,
           x_norm: centerX / frameWidth, // Normalized [0-1]
           y_norm: centerY / frameHeight,
         },
         bbox: {
           x: x, // Top-left x in pixels
           y: y, // Top-left y in pixels
           width: w, // Width in pixels
           height: h, // Height in pixels
           area: area, // Area in square pixels
           x_min_norm: bbox.x_min || 0, // Normalized coordinates
           y_min_norm: bbox.y_min || 0,
           x_max_norm: bbox.x_max || 0,
           y_max_norm: bbox.y_max || 0,
         },
         timestamp: frameTimestamp,
       };

       vehicles.push(vehicle);
     }

     // Only process frames with vehicles
     if (vehicles.length === 0) {
       return null;
     }

     // Create output message with vehicle positions
     msg.payload = {
       timestamp: frameTimestamp,
       frame_dimensions: {
         width: frameWidth,
         height: frameHeight,
       },
       vehicle_count: vehicles.length,
       vehicles: vehicles,
     };

     return msg;
     ```

#### 7.8 **Implement Hotspot Detection Algorithm**

Add a function node to calculate inter-vehicle distances and detect hotspots:

1. **Add Function Node**:
   - Drag another `function` node from the **function** section
   - Connect it after the `Extract Vehicle Positions` node

2. **Configure the Hotspot Detection Logic**:
   - **Name**: `Hotspot Detection Algorithm`
   - **Function Code**:

     ```javascript
     // Hotspot Detection Algorithm for PARKED Vehicles
     // Tracks vehicle positions across frames to identify stationary (parked) vehicles
     // Calculates hotspots only for parked vehicles

     // Initialize persistent storage
     if (!context.vehicleHistory) context.vehicleHistory = {};
     if (!context.previousHotspots) context.previousHotspots = {};

     // If no vehicles detected, return early
     if (
       !msg.payload ||
       !msg.payload.vehicles ||
       msg.payload.vehicles.length === 0
     ) {
       msg.payload = {

         hotspots: [],
         parked_vehicles: [],
       };
       return msg;
     }

     const HISTORY_TIMEOUT = 5000; // Time (ms) to keep vehicle history without updates
     const DISTANCE_MODE = "euclidean"; // Distance calculation method: "euclidean", "manhattan", etc.
     const INCLUDE_OVERLAPPING = true; // Whether overlapping vehicles are allowed in same hotspot
     const OVERLAP_THRESHOLD = 0.3; // Maximum allowed bounding box overlap fraction for separate hotspots
     const HOTSPOT_STABILITY_FRAMES = 20; // Frames a hotspot must persist to be considered stable

     // Calculate distance between two positions
     function calculateDistance(pos1, pos2, mode = DISTANCE_MODE) {
       let dx = Math.abs(pos1.x - pos2.x);

         default:
           return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
       }
     }

     // Calculate intersection over union (IoU) of two bounding boxes
     function calculateBBoxOverlap(b1, b2) {
       let xLeft = Math.max(b1.x, b2.x);

         });

#### 7.9 **Add Hotspot Analytics Output Processing**

Create a function node to generate hotspot analytics summaries and alerts:

1. **Add Function Node**:
   - Drag another `function` node from the **function** section
   - Connect it after the `Hotspot Detection Algorithm` node

2. **Configure Analytics Generator**:
   - **Name**: `Generate Hotspot Analytics`
   - **Function Code**:

     ```javascript
     // Generate Hotspot Analytics for PARKED Vehicles

     if (!msg.payload || !msg.payload.hotspots) {
       return null;
     }

     let hotspots = msg.payload.hotspots || [];
     let timestamp = msg.payload.timestamp;

     // Create table-friendly output with one row per hotspot
     let tableData = hotspots.map((hotspot, index) => {
       // Calculate average parked duration and frames for vehicles in this hotspot
       let totalDuration = 0;
       let totalFrames = 0;
       let vehicleIds = [];

       // hotspot.vehicles is an array of vehicle objects with parked_duration_ms
       for (let vehicle of hotspot.vehicles) {
         vehicleIds.push(vehicle.id);
         totalDuration += vehicle.parked_duration_ms || 0;

         // Calculate frames from duration if not available (assuming 30fps)
         let frames =
           vehicle.parked_frames ||
           Math.round((vehicle.parked_duration_ms || 0) / 33.33);
         totalFrames += frames;
       }

       let vehicleCount = hotspot.vehicles.length;
       let avgDurationSec =
         vehicleCount > 0 ? Math.round(totalDuration / vehicleCount / 1000) : 0;
       let avgFrames =
         vehicleCount > 0 ? Math.round(totalFrames / vehicleCount) : 0;

       return {
         timestamp: timestamp,
         hotspot_id: hotspot.id,
         hotspot_number: index + 1,
         vehicle_count: hotspot.vehicle_count,
         centroid_x: Math.round(hotspot.centroid.x),
         centroid_y: Math.round(hotspot.centroid.y),
         avg_distance_px: Math.round(hotspot.avg_distance),
         max_distance_px: Math.round(hotspot.max_distance),
         vehicle_ids: hotspot.vehicle_ids.replace(/_/g, ", "),
         avg_parked_duration_sec: avgDurationSec,
         avg_parked_frames: avgFrames,
       };
     });

     // If no hotspots, don't send anything
     if (tableData.length === 0) {
       return null;
     }

     // Split array into individual messages (one per hotspot)
     // Each hotspot becomes a separate MQTT message for proper Grafana table visualization
     return tableData.map((hotspot) => {
       return { payload: hotspot };
     });
     ```

#### 7.10 **Configure MQTT Output for Hotspot Analytics**

Set up a single MQTT publisher for hotspot analytics data:

1. **Add MQTT Output Node**:
   - Drag an `mqtt out` node from the **network** section
   - Connect the output of the analytics generator to this node
   - **Configure**:
     - **Server**: Same as input (`broker:1883`)
     - **Topic**: `hotspot_analytics` (or use `msg.topic` for dynamic topics)
     - **QoS**: `0`
     - **Retain**: `false`
     - **Name**: `Hotspot Analytics Publisher`

#### 7.11 **Add Debug Monitoring**

Create debug nodes to monitor the hotspot analytics pipeline:

1. **Add Debug Nodes**:
   - Add debug nodes after each function node
   - **Names**:
     - `Vehicle Positions Debug`
     - `Hotspot Detection Debug`
     - `Analytics Output Debug`

2. **Configure Debug Outputs**:
   - Set each debug node to output `msg.payload`
   - Enable console output for troubleshooting

#### 7.12 **Deploy the Crowd Analytics Flow**

1. **Deploy the Complete Flow**:
   - Click the Deploy button on the Top Right side in Node-RED interface

     {
         "source": {
             "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/videos/easy1.mp4",
             "type": "uri"
         },
         "destination": {
             "metadata": {
                 "type": "mqtt",
                 "topic": "object_detection_1",

             }
         },
         "parameters": {
             "detection-device": "CPU"
         }
     }'
     ```

     > **Note:** You can check if a pipeline is running currently with `curl -k -s https://localhost/api/pipelines/status`

#### 8.5 **Expected Results**

As per the business logic mentioned in previous steps, you will see that when a minimum of 2 cars are together (parked next to each other), it is detected as a hotspot. The metadata of the hotspot, such as the cars involved in the hotspot, for how long the cars are parked, for how many frames the cars are parked, etc., can be seen in the table.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Verify Service Status**

   Check that all services are running correctly:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. **View Live Video Stream**

   Access the processed video stream with AI annotations through WebRTC for debugging stream issues:

   ```bash
   # Open in your web browser (replace <HOST_IP> with your actual IP address)
   https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/object_detection_1/

   # For local testing, typically use localhost or 127.0.0.1
   https://localhost/mediamtx/object_detection_1/
   ```

3. **Container Startup Issues**

   If containers fail to start:

   ```bash
   # Check container logs for specific errors
   docker logs <container_name>
   ```

4. **No Data in Node-RED Debug Nodes**
   - Verify the AI application is running and generating inference data
   - Check MQTT topic names match your application's output topics
   - Ensure proper JSON parsing in function nodes

5. **Node-RED Function Node Errors**
   - Add error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Use `node.warn()` for debugging intermediate values
   - Validate input data structure before processing
   - Check that msg.payload.metadata.objects exists

6. **Vehicles are present but no hotspots detected**

   In Node-RED:
   - Verify bounding box coordinates are valid (x, y, w, h format)
   - Check centroid calculations in vehicle position extractor
   - Increase the `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` value for your specific video resolution (try 200-300 pixels).
   - Verify `MIN_HOTSPOT_SIZE` is set to 2 vehicles
   - Check vehicle filtering logic (car, truck, bus types)
   - Review proximity_pairs in debug output to see actual distances

7. **Hotspot Length Not Calculated**

   If Hotspot length shows as 0 or undefined:
   - Verify that multiple vehicles are detected in the hotspot
   - Check that distance_mode used for calculations are working
   - Review the `max_distance` field in hotspot output
   - Ensure distanceMatrix is populated correctly
