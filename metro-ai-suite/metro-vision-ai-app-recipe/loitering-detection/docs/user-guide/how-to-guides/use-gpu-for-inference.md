# Use GPU for Inference

## Prerequisites

In order to benefit from hardware acceleration, pipelines can be constructed in a manner that
different stages such as decoding, inference, etc., can make use of these devices.
For containerized applications built using the DL Streamer Pipeline Server, first we need to
provide GPU device(s) access to the container user.

### Provide GPU access to the container

This can be done by making the following changes to the Docker Compose file.

```yaml
services:
  dlstreamer-pipeline-server:
    group_add:
      # render group ID for ubuntu 22.04 host OS
      - "110"
      # render group ID for ubuntu 24.04 host OS
      - "992"
    devices:
      # you can add specific devices in case you don't want to provide access to all like below.
      - "/dev:/dev"
```

The changes above adds the container user to the `render` group and provides access to the GPU
devices.

### Hardware specific encoder/decoders

Unlike the changes done for the container above, the following requires a modification to the
media pipeline itself.

GStreamer has a variety of hardware specific encoders and decoders elements such as Intel
specific VA-API elements that you can benefit from by adding them into your media pipeline.
Examples of such elements are `vah264dec`, `vah264enc`, `vajpegdec`, etc.

Additionally, you can also enforce zero-copy of buffers using GStreamer capabilities to the
pipeline by adding `video/x-raw(memory: VAMemory)` for Intel GPUs (integrated and discrete).

Read the DL Streamer [GPU Device Selection](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/gpu_device_selection.html) document for more details.

### GPU specific element properties

DL Streamer inference elements also provides property such as `device=GPU` and `pre-process-backend=va-surface-sharing` to infer and pre-process on GPU. Read DL Streamer [docs](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/model_preparation.html#model-pre-and-post-processing) for more.

### Selecting the GPU render device of your choice if there is more than one GPU device on the system

If you have multiple GPUs (integrated/discrete), please follow the [GPU Device Selection](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/dev_guide/gpu_device_selection.html)
DL Streamer document for selecting the GPU render device of your choice for VA codecs plugins.

## Tutorial on how to use GPU specific pipelines

> **Note:** This sample application already provides a default `compose-without-scenescape.yml`
> file that includes the necessary GPU access to the containers.

The pipeline `object_tracking_gpu` in [pipeline-server-config](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/release-2026.2.0/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/loitering-detection/src/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/config.json)
contains GPU specific elements and uses GPU backend for inferencing. We can start the pipeline
as follows:

```sh
./sample_start.sh gpu
```

Go to Grafana as explained in [Get Started](../get-started.md) to view the dashboard.
