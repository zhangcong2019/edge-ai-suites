# Deploy with Trusted Compute using Helm

Use Helm to deploy Smart Intersection with Trusted Compute to a k3s cluster.
This guide will help you:

- Install and configure Intel Trusted Compute on k3s cluster.
- Configure the Helm chart for Trusted Compute deployment.
- Deploy the application with hardware-isolated workloads.
- Verify Trusted Compute runtime is active.

Intel Trusted Compute runs workloads inside hardware-isolated VMs, protecting inference workloads and video data from untrusted co-tenants on the same host. For more details on Trusted Compute, see the [Trusted Compute Documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/trusted-compute).

## Prerequisites

Before You Begin, ensure the following:

- **k3s Cluster**: Ensure you have a properly installed and configured k3s cluster.
- **System Requirements**:
  - Verify that your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
  - **Minimum RAM**: 32GB RAM is required for Trusted Compute deployments.
- **Tools Installed**: Install the required tools:
  - Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
  - Helm 3 or later
- **Storage Provisioner**: A default storage class is required for persistent volumes.

**Additional Prerequisites for GPU Deployment:**

- Intel CPU with VT-x and VT-d, integrated GPU, and IOMMU enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- Linux kernel with IOMMU, VFIO, and DRM/i915 or xe driver support

> **Note**: When GPU passthrough is enabled with Trusted Compute, the iGPU is exclusively bound to the Trusted Compute VM and is unavailable to the host or other workloads.

**Additional Prerequisites for NPU Deployment:**

- Intel CPU with VT-x, VT-d, integrated GPU, and NPU (e.g. Meteor Lake or later), with IOMMU enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- Linux kernel with IOMMU, VFIO, DRM/i915 or xe driver support, and Intel NPU driver

> **Note**: When NPU passthrough is enabled with Trusted Compute, both the iGPU and the NPU are exclusively bound to the Trusted Compute VM and are unavailable to the host or other workloads. The GPU is required alongside the NPU for video decoding.

## 1. Install Trusted Compute

Follow the [Trusted Compute baremetal installation guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/trusted-compute/blob/main/docs/trusted_compute_baremetal.md) to install Trusted Compute version 1.5.3 or later. Complete the following sections:

1. Prerequisites
2. Download the Trusted Compute Package
3. K3s Option

## 2. Prepare for Deployment

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Before you can deploy with Helm, you must clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.2.0

# Navigate to the Metro AI Suite directory
cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/
```

**Optional:** Pull the helm chart and replace the existing helm-chart folder with it.
> **Note:** The helm chart should be downloaded when you are not using the helm chart provided in `edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/smart-intersection/chart`

```bash
# Navigate to Smart Intersection directory
cd smart-intersection

# Download helm chart with the following command
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/smart-intersection --version 1.20.0-rc1

# unzip the package using the following command
tar -xvf smart-intersection-1.20.0-rc1.tgz

# Replace the helm directory
rm -rf chart && mv smart-intersection chart

cd ..
```

### Step 2: Set Up Passwords

#### Set Admin and Postgres Passwords

These passwords need to be set before deployment. You can set them in the `values.yaml` file.
```bash
# Edit the values.yaml file to set your passwords
nano ./smart-intersection/chart/values.yaml
```
Find the following sections and update them with your desired passwords:

```yaml
supass: <YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD>  # Admin password for Smart Intersection
pgpass: <YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD>  # Postgres password for Smart Intersection
```

### Step 3: Configure External IP and Proxy Settings

#### Configure External IP (Required)

The Smart Intersection application needs to know your cluster's external IP address for proper certificate generation and CSRF security configuration. Update the external IP in the `values.yaml` file:

```bash
# Edit the values.yaml file to set your external IP
nano ./smart-intersection/chart/values.yaml
```

Find the `global.externalIP` section and update it with your actual external IP address:

```yaml
# Global configuration
global:
  # External IP address for certificate generation and CSRF configuration
  externalIP: "YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_HERE"
```

Replace `YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_HERE` with your actual external IP address where the application will be accessible.

#### Configure Proxy Settings (If behind a proxy)

If you are deploying in a proxy environment, also update the proxy settings in the same `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
http_proxy: "http://your-proxy-server:port"
https_proxy: "http://your-proxy-server:port"
no_proxy: "localhost,127.0.0.1,.local,.cluster.local"
```

Replace `your-proxy-server:port` with your actual proxy server details.

### Step 4: Setup Storage Provisioner(For Single-Node Clusters)

Check if your k3s cluster has a default storage class with dynamic provisioning. If not, install a storage provisioner:

```bash
# Check for existing storage classes
kubectl get storageclass

# If no storage classes exist or none are marked as default, install local-path-provisioner
# k3s typically comes with local-path provisioner by default, but if not present:

# Install local-path-provisioner for automatic storage provisioning
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/master/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml

# Set it as default storage class
kubectl patch storageclass local-path -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'

# Verify storage class is ready
kubectl get storageclass
```

## 3. Deploy the Application

Choose one of the following paths based on whether you need GPU acceleration.

---

### Option A: CPU Deployment

Deploy the Smart Intersection application with Trusted Compute enabled on CPU:

```bash
helm upgrade --install smart-intersection ./smart-intersection/chart \
  --create-namespace \
  --set global.storageClassName="" \
  --set trustedCompute.enabled=true \
  -n smart-intersection

# Wait for all pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod --all -n smart-intersection --timeout=300s
```

> **Note:** Using `global.storageClassName=""` makes the deployment use whatever default storage class exists on your cluster.

---

### Option B: GPU Deployment

#### Step 1: Bind GPU to vfio-pci

> **Note:** Binding the GPU stops the display manager and disables the graphical display on the host. Run this step over SSH. The display is restored after running the `unbind` command.

Use the `intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh` script from the `tools/` directory of the package installed in [Step 1](#1-install-trusted-compute) to bind the Intel iGPU to the `vfio-pci` driver on each GPU-enabled k3s host.

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh bind
```

Verify the GPU is bound correctly:

```bash
lspci -nnk -d 8086: | grep -A 3 "VGA\|Display"
```

The output should show `Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci` for your Intel GPU.

#### Step 2: Deploy with GPU Enabled

```bash
helm upgrade --install smart-intersection ./smart-intersection/chart \
  --create-namespace \
  --set global.storageClassName="" \
  --set trustedCompute.enabled=true \
  --set trustedCompute.tc_gpu_enabled=true \
  -n smart-intersection

# Wait for all pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod --all -n smart-intersection --timeout=300s
```

> **Note:** Using `global.storageClassName=""` makes the deployment use whatever default storage class exists on your cluster.

---

### Option C: NPU Deployment

#### Step 1: Bind GPU to vfio-pci

> **Warning:** Binding the GPU stops the display manager and disables the graphical display on the host. Run this step over SSH. The display is restored after running the `unbind` command.

Use the `intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh` script from the `tools/` directory of the package installed in [Step 1](#1-install-trusted-compute) to bind the Intel iGPU to the `vfio-pci` driver:

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh bind
```

Verify the GPU is bound correctly:

```bash
lspci -nnk -d 8086: | grep -A 3 "VGA\|Display"
```

The output should show `Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci` for your Intel GPU.

#### Step 2: Bind NPU to vfio-pci

Use the `intel-npu-vfio-bind.sh` script from the `tools/` directory to bind the Intel NPU to the `vfio-pci` driver:

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-npu-vfio-bind.sh bind
```

Verify the NPU is bound correctly:

```bash
lspci -nnk -d 8086: | grep -A 3 "Processing accelerators"
```

The output should show `Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci` for your Intel NPU.

#### Step 3: Deploy with NPU Enabled

```bash
helm upgrade --install smart-intersection ./smart-intersection/chart \
  --create-namespace \
  --set global.storageClassName="" \
  --set trustedCompute.enabled=true \
  --set trustedCompute.tc_npu_enabled=true \
  -n smart-intersection

# Wait for all pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod --all -n smart-intersection --timeout=300s
```

> **Note:** Using `global.storageClassName=""` makes the deployment use whatever default storage class exists on your cluster.

---

## 4. Verify Deployment

Verify that the pods are running with the Trusted Compute:

```bash
# Check that DL Streamer pods are using the trusted compute
kubectl get pods -n smart-intersection -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.spec.runtimeClassName}{"\n"}{end}' | grep dlstreamer

# Verify the pods are running
kubectl get pods -n smart-intersection

# Check DL Streamer pod logs to ensure containers started successfully
kubectl logs -n smart-intersection -l app=smart-intersection-dlstreamer-pipeline-server --tail=30
```

You should see the DL Streamer Pipeline Server pods running with the Trusted Compute.

## 5. Access the Application

### Smart Intersection Application UI
- **URL**: `https://<HOST_IP>:30443/`
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: <YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD> (set in `values.yaml`)

### Grafana Dashboard
- **URL**: `https://<HOST_IP>:30443/grafana/`
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

### InfluxDB
- **URL**: `http://<HOST_IP>:30086/`
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: Get from secrets:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret smart-intersection-influxdb-secrets -n smart-intersection -o jsonpath='{.data.influxdb2-admin-password}' | base64 -d && echo
  ```

### NodeRED Editor
- **URL**: `https://<HOST_IP>:30443/nodered/`
- **No login required** - Visual programming interface

### DL Streamer Pipeline Server
- **URL**: `https://<HOST_IP>:30443/api/pipelines/status`
- **API Access**: No authentication required for status endpoints

> **Note:** For InfluxDB, use the direct access on port 30086 (`http://<HOST_IP>:30086/`) for login and full functionality. The proxy access through nginx (`https://<HOST_IP>:30443/influxdb/`) provides basic functionality and API access but is not recommended for the web UI login.

> **Security Note:** The application uses self-signed certificates for HTTPS. Your browser will show a security warning when first accessing the site. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed to site" (or equivalent) to continue. This is safe for local deployments.

## 6. Clean Up Deployment

Follow the steps below in order to cleanly remove the deployment.

**Step 1. Uninstall the application and delete the namespace:**

```bash
helm uninstall smart-intersection -n smart-intersection
kubectl delete namespace smart-intersection
```

**Step 2. Revert Device Binding** (if deployed with GPU or NPU):

If deployed with **GPU**, unbind the GPU from vfio-pci on each k3s host:

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh unbind
```

If deployed with **NPU**, unbind both the NPU and the GPU:

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-npu-vfio-bind.sh unbind
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh unbind
```

This will restore the display manager and graphical display on the host.

**Step 3. Clean Up the Trusted Compute Deployment**

To uninstall Trusted Compute from the k3s nodes after you have removed the application, refer to the [Trusted Compute documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/trusted-compute/blob/main/docs/trusted_compute_baremetal.md).

## Additional Cleanup (Optional)

For complete infrastructure cleanup, you can remove all infrastructure components installed during the setup process:

```bash
# Remove local-path-provisioner (if installed)
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/master/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml

# Delete all PVCs in the smart-intersection namespace
kubectl delete pvc --all -n smart-intersection

# Delete any remaining PVs (persistent volumes)
kubectl delete pv --all

# Force cleanup of stuck PVCs if needed (patch each PVC individually)
kubectl get pvc -n smart-intersection --no-headers | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} kubectl patch pvc {} -n smart-intersection --type merge -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}'

# Remove additional storage classes (if created)
kubectl delete storageclass hostpath local-storage standard local-path
```

> **Note:** This complete cleanup will remove storage provisioning from your cluster. You will need to reinstall the storage provisioner for future deployments that require persistent volumes.
