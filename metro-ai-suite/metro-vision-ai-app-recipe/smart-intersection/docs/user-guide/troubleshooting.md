# Troubleshooting

This page provides comprehensive support and troubleshooting information for the Smart Intersection Sample Application. It is divided into the following sections:

- **Common Issues**: General troubleshooting steps for resolving issues like container failures, port conflicts, and missing dependencies.
- **Troubleshooting Docker Deployments**: Steps to address problems specific to Docker deployments.
- **Troubleshooting Helm Deployments**: Guidance for resolving issues in Helm-based deployments.

If you encounter any problems with the application not addressed here, check the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/issues) board. Feel free
to file new tickets there (after learning about the guidelines for [Contributing](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/release-2026.2.0/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Containers Not Starting

- **Issue**: The application containers fail to start.
- **Solution**:

  ```bash
  docker compose logs
  ```

  Check the logs for errors and resolve dependency issues.

### 2. Port Conflicts

- **Issue**: Port conflicts with other running applications.
- **Solution**: Update the ports section in the Docker Compose file.

### 3. Missing Dependencies

- **Issue**: Required software dependencies are not installed.
- **Solution**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y <dependency>
  ```

### 4. Camera Stream Stuck

- **Issue**: Camera Streams seem to be stuck when Scenescape UI is accessed with localhost URL.
- **Solution**: Make sure to access the localhost URL ONLY via RDP/VNC sessions. Opening via browser extensions from a remote machine is NOT recommended.

### 5. Inaccurate detections seen when running the NPU inference pipeline on ARL and MTL NPUs

- This is a known issue tracked [here](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/issues/2230).

### 6. NPU Inference Failures with Geti-Trained Models

- **Issue**: If you experience errors or failures when running an NPU workload with a model trained in Intel Geti, this may be caused by **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** being embedded within the model graph. The NPU does not support dynamic shapes, and NMS operations with dynamic output shapes are incompatible with NPU execution.
- **Solution**: Follow the [Export and Optimize Geti Model](./export-and-optimize-geti-model.md) guide to generate a model with NMS removed from the model graph. NMS will then be handled by DL Streamer.

### 7. Application Fails to Start in Air-Gapped (No Internet) Environments

- **Issue**: When running the application on a machine without internet access, containers fail to start with errors like `failed to resolve reference`, or Grafana dashboards show "No data" even though containers appear healthy.
- **Solution**: While internet is still available, run the following preparation steps after `./install.sh smart-intersection`:

  ```bash
  # Pre-install Node-RED InfluxDB plugin into the named volume
  docker compose run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint "npm" node-red install node-red-contrib-influxdb

  # Pre-pull all container images
  docker compose pull
  ```

  After disconnecting from the Internet,
  - Export admin password as environment variable:

    ```bash
    export SUPASS=$(cat ./smart-intersection/src/secrets/supass)
    ```

  - Start the application with proxy variables(if any) unset:

    ```bash
    unset http_proxy https_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY no_proxy NO_PROXY
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Troubleshooting Docker Deployments

### 1. Containers Failing To Start

- Check the Docker logs for errors:

  ```bash
  docker compose logs
  ```

### 2. Port Conflicts:

- Update the `ports` section in the Compose file to resolve conflicts.

### 3. Reset Application

- Follow these steps to reset the application to the initial state

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  docker volume ls | grep metro-vision-ai-app-recipe | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs docker volume rm
  ```

### 4. Cleanup secrets

- Follow these steps to re-generate the secrets:

  ```bash
  rm ./src/secrets/browser.auth
  ```

- Then repeat Step 2 **Setup Credentials and Download Assets** in [Get Started](./get-started.md)

### 5. Cannot access application in remote host

- Update the firewall to receive request to port 443

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
  ```

- Stop other services that might be running in port 443 (e.g. Kubernetes Load Balancer)

### 6. Services scene or web fails to start

- On first starts, `scene` or `web` might fail to start due to a timeout on waiting for `pgserver` initialization to be ready. Restart the services with:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d scene web
  ```

### 7. Grafana shows No data when accessed remotely

- This issue occurs when there is a time synchronization mismatch between the system running the application and the system accessing Grafana through a browser. Grafana relies on timestamps to display data, and if the clocks on the two systems are not synchronized, it may result in no data being shown.
- Use Grafana's time range filter to adjust the displayed time range. Set it to match the timestamp of the data being generated by the application. This ensures that the data falls within the selected time range and becomes visible in the dashboard.
- This adjustment is particularly useful when the systems are in different time zones or have slight clock differences

### 8. Application UI shows No objects detected on scene

- This issue occurs when the scene controller is unable to establish a connection with the message broker. Ensure that the broker service is running and accessible, and verify the network configuration to allow communication between the scene controller and the broker.
- Inspect the logs of the scene controller with:

  ```bash
  docker compose logs scene
  ```

- When the scene controller can't connect to the broker, the following log lines are shown:

  ```text
  Starting scene controller
  Broker broker.scenescape.intel.com online: [Errno 111] Connection refused
  Broker broker.scenescape.intel.com online: [Errno 111] Connection refused
  Broker broker.scenescape.intel.com online: Connecting
  ```

- To address this issue, restart the scene controller:

  ```bash
  docker compose down scene
  docker compose up -d scene
  ```

- Then verify that the container is ready:

  ```text
  Broker broker.scenescape.intel.com online: Connecting
  Broker broker.scenescape.intel.com online: 0
  Took 1 seconds
  Container is ready
  ```

- Now the Application UI should show objects detected on scene.

  > **Note:** For Helm deployments, use the equivalent commands to inspect logs and restart the scene controller.

- Inspect the logs:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs pod/<scene-pod-name> -n smart-intersection
  ```

- Restart the scene controller:

  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod/<scene-pod-name> -n smart-intersection
  ```

### 9. Accessing the MQTT Broker Externally

- **Issue**: You want to connect an external MQTT client to the broker for debugging or monitoring topics.
- **Solution**: Expose port 1883 on the broker service by adding a `ports` section in `docker-compose.yml`:

  ```yaml
  broker:
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"
  ```

- Then restart the broker:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --force-recreate broker
  ```

- Connect using an MQTT client with TLS and the CA certificate:

  ```bash
  mosquitto_sub -h <HOST_IP> -p 1883 \
    --cafile ./smart-intersection/src/secrets/certs/scenescape-ca.pem \
    -t '#' -v
  ```

  > **Note:** The broker uses TLS (TLSv1.3) but allows anonymous connections — no username/password is required. You must use an MQTT client (not a web browser) since MQTT is a TCP protocol, not HTTP.

## Troubleshooting Helm Deployments

### 1. Helm Chart Not Found

- Check if the Helm repository was added:

  ```bash
  helm repo list
  ```

### 2. Pods Not Running

- Review pod logs:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs {{pod-name}} -n {{namespace}}
  ```

### 3. Service Unreachable

- Confirm the service configuration:

  ```bash
  kubectl get svc -n {{namespace}}
  ```

### 4. DL Streamer Pipeline Server Pod Stuck in Pending State

- **Issue**: When `gpu.enabled` is set to `true` or `npu.enabled` is set to `true` in `values.yaml`, the DL Streamer Pipeline Server pod remains in `Pending` state and does not get scheduled.
- **Cause**: The deployment requests `gpu.intel.com/i915` (or the configured `gpu.type`) or `npu.intel.com/accel` as a resource limit. If the node does not have the corresponding hardware or the Intel Device Plugin is not installed, Kubernetes cannot satisfy the resource request and the pod will not be scheduled.
- **Diagnosis**: Check the pod events for the scheduling failure:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod -n smart-intersection -l app=smart-intersection-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | grep -A 5 "Events:"
  ```

  You will see an event message like:

  ```text
  Warning  FailedScheduling  default-scheduler  0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient gpu.intel.com/i915.
  ```

  or:

  ```text
  Warning  FailedScheduling  default-scheduler  0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient npu.intel.com/accel.
  ```

  > **Note:** If your node uses Intel Xe discrete GPUs (Arc), you will see `gpu.intel.com/xe` instead of `gpu.intel.com/i915`.

- **Verification**: Confirm whether the GPU and/or NPU resources are available on your nodes:

  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o json | jq '.items[] | {name: .metadata.name, gpu: .status.allocatable["gpu.intel.com/i915"], npu: .status.allocatable["npu.intel.com/accel"]}'
  ```

  If the output shows `"gpu": null` or `"npu": null`, the corresponding Intel Device Plugin is not installed or the node does not have the required hardware.

- **Solution**: Ensure the [Intel Device Plugins for Kubernetes](https://github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes) (NFD + GPU plugin + NPU plugin) are installed on your cluster and that the target node has the required hardware. See the [Prerequisites](./get-started/deploy-with-helm.md#prerequisites) section for installation steps.

  > **Note:** If your node uses Intel Xe discrete GPUs (Arc), set `gpu.type` to `gpu.intel.com/xe` in `values.yaml`.

### 5. Accessing the MQTT Broker Externally

- **Issue**: You want to connect an external MQTT client to the broker for debugging or monitoring topics in a Helm deployment.
- **Solution**: Use `kubectl port-forward` to expose the broker service locally:

  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/smart-intersection-broker -n smart-intersection 1883:1883
  ```

- Then connect using an MQTT client with TLS:

  ```bash
  mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 \
    --cafile <path-to-scenescape-ca.pem> \
    -t '#' -v
  ```

  > **Note:** The broker uses TLS (TLSv1.3) but allows anonymous connections — no username/password is required. You must use an MQTT client (not a web browser) since MQTT is a TCP protocol, not HTTP.
