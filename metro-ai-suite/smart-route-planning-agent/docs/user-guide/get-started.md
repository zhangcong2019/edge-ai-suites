# Get Started

## Prerequisites

- **System requirements**: Verify that your system meets the [minimum requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md).

- **Docker platform**: Install Docker platform. For installation instructions, see [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- You are familiar with Docker commands and using the terminal. If you are new to Docker
platform, see [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for an introduction.

## Quick Start with Setup Script

Intel recommends using the unified setup script `setup.sh` that configures, builds, deploys,
and manages the Smart Route Planning Agent.

1. Clone the suite:

   Go to the target directory of your choice and clone the suite.
   If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `release-2026.2.0` with the desired tag.
   To learn more on partial cloning, check the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

   ```bash
   git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch release-2026.2.0 https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
   cd edge-ai-suites
   git sparse-checkout set metro-ai-suite
   cd metro-ai-suite/smart-route-planning-agent
   ```

2. Run the application:

   The setup script provides several options. For running the service by pulling the official image (recommended for first-time
   users):

   ```bash
   source setup.sh --run
   ```

3. **Alternative setup options :**

   For a more granular control, run these commands as per your requirement:

   ```bash
   # Build application image only (without starting containers)
   source setup.sh --build

   # Build application image locally and run the services
   source setup.sh --setup

   # Stop all services
   source setup.sh --stop

   # Restart services
   source setup.sh --restart

   # Clean up containers, volumes, images, networks, and all related resources
   source setup.sh --clean
   ```

## Manual Setup for Advanced Users

For advanced users who need more control over the configuration, you can set up the stack
manually using Docker Compose tool.

### Manual Environment Configuration

If you prefer to configure environment variables manually instead of using the setup script,
see the [Environment Variables Guide](./get-started/environment-variables.md) for details.

### Manual Docker Compose Tool Deployment

See [Build from Source](./get-started/build-from-source.md) for instructions on building and
running with the Docker Compose tool.

### Helm Deployment

See [Deploy with Helm](./get-started/deploy-with-helm.md) for a simple Kubernetes deployment flow.

## Multi-Node Deployment

The Smart Route Planning Agent works in a multi-node setup with one central Route Planning
Agent and multiple Smart Traffic Intersection Agent edge nodes.

### Architecture Overview

![Architecture Overview](./_assets/smart-route-agent-architecture-overview.svg "Architecture Overview")

### Multi-Node Deployment Prerequisites

1. Deploy the [Smart Traffic Intersection Agent](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-suites/smart-traffic-intersection-agent/get-started.html#quick-start-with-setup-script) on each edge node.
2. Ensure network connectivity between the central node and edge nodes.
3. Note the IP address and port of each Smart Traffic Intersection Agent.

### Configure Edge Node Endpoints

Edit `src/data/config.json` to add the IP addresses and ports of the edge nodes where Smart Traffic Intersection Agents are running.

#### Example Configuration

```json
{
    "api_endpoint": "/api/v1/traffic/current/ws?images=false",
    "api_hosts": [
        {
            "host": "ws://<node-1-ip>:<port>"
        },
        {
            "host": "ws://<node-2-ip>:<port>"
        },
        {
            "host": "ws://<node-3-ip>:<port>"
        }
    ]
}
```

> **NOTE :** We can add `api_hosts` for even just one instance, however minimum three instances of Smart Traffic Intersection Agent is recommended for proper route planning in the application.

### Deploy the Route Planning Agent

After configuring the edge node endpoints, deploy the Smart Route Planning Agent on the
central node:

```bash
source setup.sh --setup
```

The Route Planning Agent will query all configured Smart Traffic Intersection Agents to gather
live traffic data for route optimization.
