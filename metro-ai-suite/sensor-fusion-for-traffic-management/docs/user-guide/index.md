A multi-modal reference implementation to accurately monitor traffic conditions by fusing
camera and sensor inputs. While cameras capture high-resolution visual data, radar and lidar
sensors precisely measure speed and distance, even under challenging conditions such as fog,
rain, or darkness.

Two complementary implementations are available:

- **[Post-Fusion](post-fusion/index.md)**: the original camera + radar and camera + lidar pipelines that fuse
  independently processed sensor tracks after detection.
- **[Intermediate-Fusion](intermediate-fusion/index.md)**: a BEVFusion-based implementation that fuses camera and lidar
  features before the detection head for higher 3D object detection accuracy.

Choose the implementation that matches your sensor configuration and deployment requirements.
