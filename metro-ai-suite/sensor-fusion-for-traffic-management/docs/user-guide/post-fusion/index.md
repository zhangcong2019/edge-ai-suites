A multi-modal reference implementation that accurately monitors traffic conditions by blending
camera and sensor inputs. While cameras capture high-resolution visual data, radar/lidar
sensors precisely measure the speed and distance, even under challenging conditions, such as
fog, rain, or darkness.

This integration improves on the camera-only solutions in performance, accuracy, and
reliability, offering a more robust and comprehensive approach to traffic monitoring and
management.

This sample features multiple pipelines tailored to specific sensor fusion use cases, combining
cameras with either radar or lidar:

- One camera paired with one mmWave radar (1C+1R)
- Two cameras paired with one mmWave radar (2C+1R)
- Four cameras paired with four mmWave radars (4C+4R)
- Sixteen cameras paired with four mmWave radars (16C+4R)
- Two cameras paired with one lidar (2C+1L)
- Four cameras paired with two lidars (4C+2L)
- Twelve cameras paired with two lidars (12C+2L)
- Eight cameras paired with four lidars (8C+4L)
- Twelve cameras paired with four lidars (12C+4L)
