"""Tests for latest.jpg snapshot writing.

Regression guard for a bug found during early integration testing:
cv2.imwrite dispatches by file extension, so an `<x>.jpg.tmp` tmp filename
fails with "could not find a writer for the specified extension". The
exception was being swallowed by the broad try/except, making the failure
silent — no log line, no latest.jpg.

These tests directly drive `_maybe_write_snapshot()` so the bug is caught
at unit-test time, not at integration.
