# tools/

Validation utilities for `videostream-analytics`. These are *not* unit/integration
tests — they require a ground-truth SRT and either a running mock webhook or an
exported events JSON. Keep them out of `tests/` so pytest discovery stays clean.

Current video corpus layout (relative to repo root):
- `../demo/videos/cam_child/...`
- `../demo/videos/cam_fridge/...`
- `../demo/videos/cam_elder_bedroom/...`
- `../demo/videos/cam_elder_bedroom_2/...`

## Quick map

| Tool | Use when |
|---|---|
| `run_eval.sh` | run a scenario end-to-end and print prefilter Recall/Precision |
| `eval_prefilter_from_webhook.py` | re-evaluate a saved events dump (offline replay) |
| `render_eval_timeline.py` | eyeball *why* a cue was MISS or an event was FP — ASCII timeline |

## render_eval_timeline.py — debug-level timeline visualization

Reads the same `events.json` + GT SRT (+ optional `status.json` for an exact
anchor) as `eval_prefilter_from_webhook.py` and prints a side-by-side ASCII
timeline. Pure stdout, no matplotlib — works over SSH and in CI logs.

When to use it: a Recall < 100% or a non-zero FP count from `run_eval.sh`.
The timeline tells you whether the gap is a *detection* problem (cue has no
event nearby at all) or a *time-window alignment* problem (event is right
next to the cue but missed by a fraction of a second). Fridge §24.6 was the
latter — `--tolerance 2.0` recovers it.

```bash
# Use the dumps run_eval.sh leaves behind (file paths printed at end of run):
.venv/bin/python tools/render_eval_timeline.py \
  --srt ../demo/videos/cam_fridge/demo006-2_expanded_20min_v2_groundtruth.srt \
    --events-json /tmp/fridge_events_<pid>.json \
    --status-json /tmp/fridge_status_<pid>.json \
    --source-id cam_fridge --ss 0

# Loosen overlap match by ±2s — same flag as the evaluator:
.venv/bin/python tools/render_eval_timeline.py ... --tolerance 2.0

# Drop [EMPTY] cues so they don't pollute the picture (elder scenarios):
.venv/bin/python tools/render_eval_timeline.py ... --exclude-label-pattern '\[EMPTY\]'
```

Output anatomy: GT cues stacked above (`[==X==]` MISS, `[==D==]` HIT-danger,
etc.), motion events stacked below (`{----}` HIT, `{****}` FP), shared time
axis at the bottom. Followed by the same Recall/Precision summary you'd get
from the evaluator.

## run_eval.sh — one-shot end-to-end evaluation across all scenarios

Wraps the manual recipe (mediamtx → mock webhook → analytics → ffmpeg push →
register source → wait → evaluate) for every phase-2 scenario into one
command. Trap-based cleanup so nothing leaks on Ctrl-C.

### Scenarios

Design doc lists 3 use cases (`child_safety`, `elder_wakeup`,
`refrigerator_monitor`); they expand to 4 scenarios because `elder_wakeup`
has 2 input videos:

| Scenario | source_id | Use case | Video | ss | Prefilter | GT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `child` | cam_child | child_safety | `VSA_EVAL_CHILD_VIDEO` | 40 | on | yes |
| `fridge` | cam_fridge | fridge | `VSA_EVAL_FRIDGE_VIDEO` | 0 | **off** | yes (4 [TAKE] cues) |
| `elder_day1` | cam_elder_bedroom | elder_wakeup | `VSA_EVAL_ELDER_VIDEO` | 0 | on | yes (excl `[EMPTY]`) |
| `elder_day2` | cam_elder_bedroom_2 | elder_wakeup | `VSA_EVAL_ELDER_2_VIDEO` | 0 | on | yes (excl `[EMPTY]`) |

Notes:
- Set the corresponding `VSA_EVAL_*_VIDEO` variables to local MP4 files before running an evaluation. Videos are not distributed with the repository.
- `fridge` runs with `prefilter.enabled=false` because `target_classes=["person"]`
  would filter out hand-only motion.
- `elder_*` GT cue 3 is `[EMPTY]` (no person); the eval excludes it via
  `--exclude-label-pattern '\[EMPTY\]'` so Recall reflects only real
  `[SLEEPING]` / `[WAKEUP]` cues.

### Usage

```bash
# All 4 scenarios, sequentially (longest path: ~20 min for fridge alone).
bash tools/run_eval.sh

# Single scenario
bash tools/run_eval.sh --scenario child
bash tools/run_eval.sh --scenario fridge
bash tools/run_eval.sh --scenario elder_day1
bash tools/run_eval.sh --scenario elder_day2

# Smoke mode — much shorter waits (60-120s per scenario), useful to
# verify pipeline plumbing without waiting for full GT coverage.
bash tools/run_eval.sh --wait-mode short

# Leave services running after the last scenario (manual cleanup).
bash tools/run_eval.sh --keep

# Env knobs (rarely needed)
MEDIAMTX_BIN=~/bin/mediamtx bash tools/run_eval.sh
ANALYTICS_PORT=18999 bash tools/run_eval.sh
```

### What it does

1. Boots shared infra **once**: MediaMTX (if `:8554` free; reuses otherwise) +
   mock webhook on `:9999` + analytics on `:8999`.
2. For each requested scenario:
   - Clears `/recorded_events` (so dumps don't mix across scenarios)
   - ffmpeg pushes the scenario's video with the right `--ss`
   - Registers the source with the right `use_case` and prefilter setting
   - Sleeps `<wait>` seconds (`full` mode = covers all GT cues; `short` = smoke)
   - Snapshots `/recorded_events` + `/sources/{id}` to `/tmp/<scen>_events_<pid>.json`
     and `/tmp/<scen>_status_<pid>.json`
   - Runs `eval_prefilter_from_webhook.py` in `--anchor-mode stream-start`
     (with `--exclude-label-pattern '\[EMPTY\]'` for elder scenarios)
   - Stops the source + ffmpeg before moving on
3. On EXIT/INT/TERM: stops all sources, kills mock + analytics + ffmpeg + (if
   we started it) mediamtx. `--keep` skips step 3 and prints the PIDs.

Pre-flight refuses to start if `:8999` or `:9999` are already taken — usually
a stale `uvicorn` from a previous `--keep` run. The error message gives you
the exact `kill $(lsof ...)` command.

## eval_prefilter_from_webhook.py

Webhook-source variant of the phase-2 prototype's `eval_prefilter_coverage.py`.
Computes prefilter `Recall` and `Precision` against a GT SRT.

### Why `--ss` and `--anchor-mode` matter

The phase-2 prototype evaluator did not need any anchor parameter because the
prototype ran on a `cv2.VideoCapture(file.mp4)` loop — `start_video_s = frame_count / fps`
is naturally in the same coordinate as the GT SRT. This service is RTSP-only:
events carry wall-clock ISO timestamps, never video seconds. So we need to
align wall-clock T0 to a known point in the video.

Three modes (recommended → fallback):

| mode | wall-clock T0 source | accuracy | requires |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stream-start` (default) | `GET /sources/{id}` → `health.start_time` | exact | service running, `--source-id` |
| `first-event` | earliest motion event's `start_time` | drifts by 5-15s (motion warmup) | nothing |
| `wallclock` | `--anchor-wallclock <ISO>` | as accurate as you measure | manual |

`--ss` is video-time T0: pass the same value you used for ffmpeg `-ss N` when
pushing the demo video. For `scripts/test-videostream-analytics.sh` this is
`40` for child, `0` for fridge/elder.

### End-to-end recipe (recommended)

```bash
cd videostream-analytics

# 1. Start the test scenario in one terminal — leave it running:
bash scripts/test-videostream-analytics.sh --local --integration-only

# 2. In another terminal, evaluate while the service is still up.
#    --anchor-mode stream-start asks the service for the real stream-open time.
.venv/bin/python tools/eval_prefilter_from_webhook.py \
  --srt ../demo/videos/cam_child/child_safety_demo_groundtruth.srt \
    --source-id cam_child --ss 40
```

### Offline replay (after service shut down)

Dump events to disk before the test script's cleanup runs, then replay anytime:

```bash
# during the test run:
curl -s http://localhost:9999/recorded_events > /tmp/child_events.json

# anytime later — note: first-event anchor drifts, so HIT/MISS may shift
# by ±10s for cues near the video start. For exact replay, snapshot
# /sources/cam_child as well and use --anchor-mode wallclock.
.venv/bin/python tools/eval_prefilter_from_webhook.py \
    --srt <gt.srt> --events-json /tmp/child_events.json \
    --source-id cam_child --anchor-mode first-event --ss 40
```

### What it can NOT measure

- `prefilter_skip` count, skip rate, `PARTIAL` status.
  These need the in-process `pipeline.db.tasks` table that only the phase-2
  prototype writes. The new microservice stays silent on skip, so anything that
  motion+prefilter together dropped just shows up as `MISS`.
  For that breakdown, run the prototype's
  `phase2-prototype-demo/tools/eval_prefilter_coverage.py` on its `pipeline.db`.

- VLM alert accuracy (Recall/Precision/F1, alert latency).
  That belongs to the MCP Server side: it owns the `alerts` table populated by
  `evaluate_rules`. Once the full link `videostream-analytics → /events → VLM →
  alert` is wired, point the prototype's `eval_alert_accuracy.py` at the MCP
  Server's per-monitor DB (it's schema-compatible by design — see
  `docs/design/db-schema-design.md`).
