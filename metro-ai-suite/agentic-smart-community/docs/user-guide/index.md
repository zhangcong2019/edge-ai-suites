::::

An AI-agent-native video analysis platform built on the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. It hands AI agents a universal, framework-agnostic toolkit for video surveillance and analysis, so they can autonomously create, manage, and respond to custom use cases — with no changes to core components.

Concretely, an agent can remind you when the fridge is running low on groceries, alert a parent the instant a child climbs onto a window sill, or flag when an elderly family member hasn't gotten up on time — and you can add a brand-new use case just by describing it in chat.

> **New here?** Bring the stack up in a few commands with the **[Get Started Guide](./get-started.md)**.

## Example Use Cases

These demos are validated end-to-end. They are only a starting point — describe a new scenario in chat and trigger a new use case monitoring by following [Register a New Use Case](./how-to-guides/register-new-use-case.md).

| Use Case | Description | Proactive Alerts |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Fridge Monitor | Refrigerator monitoring — regular reports (food shortage alerts, diet adjustment suggestions, lifestyle/fitness recommendations) + interactive chat with agents for personalized Q&A | No |
| Child Safety | Child danger alert notification — real-time detection of risky behaviors (jumping from heights, playing with knives/fire, etc.), immediate alerts to parents, daily summaries, and follow-up conversations | Yes |
| Elder Wakeup | Elder care (wake-up tracking) — monitor daily wake-up times, alert caregivers on significant deviations, weekly summary reports, and follow-up reminders | Yes |
