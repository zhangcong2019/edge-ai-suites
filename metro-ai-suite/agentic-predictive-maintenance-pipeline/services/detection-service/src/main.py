"""FastAPI entry point for the detection-service.

Owns the entire detection lifecycle, independent of the agent/reasoning
layer: starting and polling the DL Streamer pipeline, subscribing to raw
detection events over MQTT and persisting them to the storage-service, and
publishing a "batch-complete" event once a run finishes so the (detection-
agnostic) agent-service can react without ever calling back into this
service.
