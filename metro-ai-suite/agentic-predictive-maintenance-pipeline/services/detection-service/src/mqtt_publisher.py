"""MQTT publisher — announces "batch-complete" events when a detection run finishes.

This is the sole contract between the detection layer and the (detection-
agnostic) agent-service: once a detection run reaches a terminal state, the
detection layer publishes one event describing the outcome and the id window
of detections it produced. The agent-service subscribes to this topic and
reasons only when it observes a ``status: completed`` event — it never talks
to DL Streamer or any other detector directly.
