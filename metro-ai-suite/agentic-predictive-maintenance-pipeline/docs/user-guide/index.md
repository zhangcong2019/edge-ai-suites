The Agentic Predictive Maintenance (APM) blueprint is a configuration-driven, multi-agent sample
application for industrial defect detection on Intel® edge hardware. It processes live or recorded
video to detect defects, stores detection data, and uses a LangGraph framework-based multi-agent pipeline to
analyze findings and generate structured maintenance tickets without any code changes between use
cases.

You can extend the application to new industrial inspection scenarios by editing
configuration files.

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-time defect detection**: DL Streamer runs a YOLO model against video input and publishes
  detection events over Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT).
- **Multi-agent reasoning**: A LangGraph pipeline with four specialized agents (Policy, Analysis,
  Evidence, Ticketing) processes detections and produces actionable maintenance tickets.
- **Two operating modes**: Run fully with a Large Language Model (LLM) for AI-generated analysis,
  or in the fallback mode with rule-based logic when no GPU or LLM service is available.
- **Configuration-driven extensibility**: Adapt the blueprint to any defect detection use case by
  editing four configuration files. No code changes are required.
- **Built-in observability**: Both the storage and agent services expose Prometheus metrics.
