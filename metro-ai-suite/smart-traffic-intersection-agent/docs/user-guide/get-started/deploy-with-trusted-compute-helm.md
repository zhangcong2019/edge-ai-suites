# Deploy with Trusted Compute using Helm

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Smart Traffic Intersection Agent application with Intel Trusted Compute using Helm on a k3s cluster.

Intel Trusted Compute runs workloads inside hardware-isolated VMs, protecting inference workloads and model data from untrusted co-tenants on the same host.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- k3s cluster set up and running.
- Verify that your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
  - **Minimum RAM**: 32GB RAM is required for Trusted Compute deployments.
- Helm installed on your system: [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
- The cluster must support **dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes (PV)**. Refer to the [Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioning Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) for more details.
- A running **Smart Intersection** deployment (provides MQTT broker, camera pipelines, and scene analytics).
- The Scenescape CA certificate file (`scenescape-ca.pem`) for TLS connections to the MQTT broker (created during the Smart Intersection installation).
- *(Optional)* A [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) API token if the VLM model requires authentication.
- **Storage Requirement:** The VLM model cache PVC requests 20 GiB by default. Ensure the cluster has sufficient storage available.

**Additional Prerequisites for GPU Deployment:**

- Intel CPU with VT-x and VT-d, integrated GPU, and IOMMU enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- Linux kernel with IOMMU, VFIO, and DRM/i915 or xe driver support

> **Note**: When GPU passthrough is enabled with Trusted Compute, the iGPU is exclusively bound to the Trusted Compute VM and is unavailable to the host or other workloads.

## 1. Install Trusted Compute

Follow the [Trusted Compute baremetal installation guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/trusted-compute/blob/main/docs/trusted_compute_baremetal.md) to install Trusted Compute version 1.5.3 or later. Complete the following sections:

1. Prerequisites
2. Download the Trusted Compute Package
3. K3s Option

## 2. Prepare for Deployment

The following steps walk through preparing the Helm chart for deployment. You can install from source code or pull the chart from a registry.

**_Steps 1 to 3 vary depending on whether you prefer to build or pull the Helm chart._**

### Option 1: Install from a Registry

#### Step 1: Pull the Chart

Use the following command to pull the Helm chart:

```bash
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/smart-traffic-intersection-agent --version <version-no>
```

Refer to release notes for details on the latest version to use.

#### Step 2: Extract the `.tgz` File

After pulling the chart, extract the `.tgz` file:

```bash
tar -xvf smart-traffic-intersection-agent-<version-no>.tgz
```

Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd smart-traffic-intersection-agent
```

#### Step 3: Configure the `values.yaml` File

Edit the `values.yaml` file to set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the [values reference table](./deploy-with-helm.md#valuesyaml-reference).

---

### Option 2: Install from Source

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the Helm chart:

```bash
# Clone the latest on mainline
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b main
# Alternatively, clone a specific release branch
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b <release-tag>
```

#### Step 2: Change to the Chart Directory

Navigate to the chart directory:

```bash
cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/smart-traffic-intersection-agent/chart
```

#### Step 3: Build Chart Dependencies

The chart uses Helm subcharts for the OVMS model server and the metrics manager. Build them before installing:

```bash
helm dependency build .
```

This downloads/packages the `ovms` and `metrics-manager` subcharts into `chart/charts/*.tgz`,
which Helm requires at render/install time. Re-run this command whenever the subchart sources
under `subcharts/` change.

```bash
helm lint .
```

#### Step 4: Configure the `values.yaml` File

Edit the `values.yaml` file to set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the [values reference table](./deploy-with-helm.md#valuesyaml-reference).

---

### Supported VLM Models

The default model is `OpenVINO/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct-int8-ov`. To use a different model, override it at install time:

```bash
helm install stia . -n <your-namespace> --create-namespace \
  --set ovms.trustedCompute.enabled=true \
  --set ovms.env.modelName=OpenVINO/InternVL2-1B-int4-ov
```

| Model | Structured JSON | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OpenVINO/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct-int8-ov` | Good | Default. Pre-converted OpenVINO model; avoids on-cluster Hugging Face export flow. |
| `OpenVINO/InternVL2-1B-int4-ov` | Good | Pre-converted OpenVINO alternative model; avoids on-cluster Hugging Face export flow. |

> **Note:** The OVMS init container downloads and converts the selected model on first startup. Changing the model name requires deleting the existing model cache PVC so the init container re-downloads the new model.

## 3. Deploy the Application

Choose one of the following paths based on whether you need GPU acceleration.

---

### Option A: CPU Deployment

Deploy the Smart Traffic Intersection Agent with Trusted Compute enabled on CPU:

```bash
helm install stia . -n <your-namespace> --create-namespace \
  --set ovms.trustedCompute.enabled=true \
  --set ovms.gpu.enabled=false
```

> **Note:** If the prerequisite **Smart Intersection** deployment is using the GPU or NPU, the GPU is not available for Metrics Manager telemetry in this deployment. Disable GPU telemetry by adding `--set metricsManager.hardware.gpu.enabled=false` to the command above.

---

### Option B: GPU Deployment

#### Step 1: Bind GPU to vfio-pci

> **Note:** Binding the GPU stops the display manager and disables the graphical display on the host. Run this step over SSH. The display is restored after running the `unbind` command.

Use the `intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh` script from the `tools/` directory of the package installed in [Step 1](#1-install-trusted-compute) to bind the Intel iGPU to the `vfio-pci` driver on each GPU-enabled k3s host.

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh bind
```

Verify the GPU is bound correctly:

```bash
lspci -nnk -d 8086: | grep -A 3 "VGA\|Display"
```

The output should show `Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci` for your Intel GPU.

#### Step 2: Deploy with GPU Enabled

```bash
helm install stia . -n <your-namespace> --create-namespace \
  --set ovms.trustedCompute.enabled=true \
  --set ovms.trustedCompute.tc_gpu_enabled=true \
  --set ovms.gpu.enabled=false \
  --set metricsManager.hardware.gpu.enabled=false
```

---

> **Note:** When Trusted Compute is enabled, the OVMS VLM serving service type is automatically set to `ClusterIP` instead of the default `NodePort`. This restricts the model server to in-cluster access only, ensuring the inference endpoint is not externally exposed. To access the OVMS service for debugging, use `kubectl port-forward`.

## 4. Verify Deployment

Verify that the pods are running with the Trusted Compute:

```bash
# Check that OVMS pods are using the trusted compute
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace> -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.spec.runtimeClassName}{"\n"}{end}' | grep ovms

# Verify the pods are running
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>

# Check OVMS pod logs to ensure containers started successfully
kubectl logs -n <your-namespace> -l app=stia-ovms-service
```

You should see the OVMS VLM serving pods running with the Trusted Compute.

Wait until all pods show `Running` and `READY 1/1`:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=stia -n <your-namespace> --timeout=600s
```

## 5. Access and Verify the Application

Once the pods are ready, access the application. The chart deploys services as `NodePort` by default. Retrieve the allocated ports and node IP:

```bash
# Get the NodePort values
kubectl get svc stia-traffic-agent -n <your-namespace>

# Find the node where the traffic-agent pod is running
kubectl get pod -n <your-namespace> -o wide | grep traffic-agent

# Use the INTERNAL-IP of that node
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Then open your browser at:

- **Backend API:** `http://<node-ip>:<backend-node-port>/docs`
- **Gradio UI:** `http://<node-ip>:<ui-node-port>`

### Verify the Application

Follow these verification steps to ensure the application is running correctly:

- Ensure that all pods are running and the services are accessible.
- Access the Gradio UI and verify that it is showing the traffic intersection dashboard.
- Check the backend API at `/docs` for the interactive Swagger documentation.
- Verify that the traffic agent is receiving MQTT messages from Scenescape by checking the logs:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app=stia-traffic-agent -n <your-namespace> -f
  ```

## 6. Clean Up Deployment

Follow the steps below in order to cleanly remove the deployment.

**Step 1. Uninstall the Application:**

```bash
helm uninstall stia -n <your-namespace>
```

> **Note:** When `ovms.persistence.keepOnUninstall` is `true` (the default), the VLM model cache PVC is **retained** after uninstall to avoid re-downloading the model. This is recommended during development and testing. To fully clean up all PVCs:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl get pvc -n <your-namespace>
> kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name> -n <your-namespace>
> ```
>
> To have Helm delete the PVC automatically on uninstall, set `ovms.persistence.keepOnUninstall=false` before deploying.

**Step 2. Revert GPU Binding** (if deployed with GPU):

On each k3s host where the GPU was bound, unbind it from vfio-pci:

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh unbind
```

This will restore the display manager and graphical display on the host.

**Step 3. Clean Up the Trusted Compute Deployment:**

To uninstall Trusted Compute from the k3s nodes after you have removed the application, refer to the [Trusted Compute documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/trusted-compute/blob/main/docs/trusted_compute_baremetal.md).
