# Deploy with Trusted Compute

 This guide shows you how to:

- Set up the agent with Trusted Compute using the automated setup script for hardware-isolated deployment.
- Install and configure Trusted Compute on your host system.
- Access the agent's features to explore its functionality with enhanced security.
- Configure settings to suit specific requirements.

Intel Trusted Compute runs workloads inside hardware-isolated VMs, protecting inference workloads and model data from untrusted co-tenants on the same host.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- **System requirements**: Verify that your system meets the [minimum requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md).
  - **Minimum RAM**: 32GB RAM is required for Trusted Compute deployments.
- **Docker platform**: Install Docker platform. For installation instructions, see [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) Broker**: Ensure access to an MQTT broker for traffic data streaming, or use the included broker.
- **Docker commands and terminal usage**: You are familiar with Docker commands and using the terminal. If you are new to Docker, see [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for an introduction.
- **Hugging Face token**: Set your token using `export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="<your-huggingface-token>"`
- **Registry configuration**: To pull pre-built images from a specific registry, set the `REGISTRY` and `TAG` parameters. The recommended default setting is below.

  ```bash
  export REGISTRY="intel"
  export TAG="2026.2.0-rc1"
  ```

**Additional Prerequisites for GPU Deployment:**
- Intel CPU with VT-x and VT-d, integrated GPU, and IOMMU enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- Linux kernel with IOMMU, VFIO, and DRM/i915 or xe driver support

> **Note**: When GPU passthrough is enabled, the iGPU is exclusively bound to the Trusted Compute VM and is unavailable to the host or other workloads.

## 1. Install Trusted Compute

Follow the [Trusted Compute baremetal installation guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/trusted-compute/blob/main/docs/trusted_compute_baremetal.md) to install Trusted Compute version 1.5.3 or later on your host system. Complete the following sections:

1. Prerequisites
2. Download the Trusted Compute Package
3. Docker Option

## 2. Setup and Prepare for Deployment

Intel recommends using the automated setup script that handles environment configuration, dependencies setup, secrets generation, building, and deployment of the Smart Traffic Intersection Agent.

### 1. Clone the Suite

Go to the target directory of your choice and clone the suite.
If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `release-2026.2.0` with the desired tag.
To learn more on partial cloning, check the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch release-2026.2.0 https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
cd edge-ai-suites
git sparse-checkout set metro-ai-suite
cd metro-ai-suite/smart-traffic-intersection-agent/
```

### 2. Set the required environment variables

```bash
export VLM_MODEL_NAME=<supported_model_name>  # eg. OpenVINO/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct-int8-ov, OpenVINO/InternVL2-1B-int4-ov
```

The application has been validated with following models:

| Model | `VLM_MODEL_NAME` |
|-------|-----------------|
| Microsoft Phi-3.5 Vision (pre-converted) | `OpenVINO/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct-int8-ov` |
| Microsoft Phi-3.5 Vision (raw, auto-converted) | `microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct` |
| Qwen2-VL 2B (pre-converted) | `OpenVINO/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct-int4-ov` |
| Qwen2-VL 7B (pre-converted) | `OpenVINO/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-int4-ov` |
| InternVL2 1B (pre-converted) | `OpenVINO/InternVL2-1B-int4-ov` |

> **Note:** Both pre-converted OpenVINO models (under the `OpenVINO/` namespace on Hugging Face) and raw Hugging Face VLM models (for example, `microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct`) are supported. Raw models are automatically downloaded and converted to OpenVINO format during setup.

> **IMPORTANT:** See this [disclaimer](#disclaimer-for-using-third-party-ai-models) before using any AI Model.

### 3. Configure Network Settings (Optional)

By default, Trusted Compute uses the subnet `172.20.0.0/16` for isolated container networking. If this subnet conflicts with your existing networks, you can customize it before deployment.

**Requirements:**

- Subnet format must be exactly `172.X.0.0/16` where X is between 18-31 (RFC 1918 private IP range)
- The subnet must not conflict with existing Docker networks on your system
- DNS relay service will be automatically configured at `172.X.0.200`

**Example:**

```bash
# Optional: Customize the subnet if needed (default is 172.20.0.0/16)
export TC_SUBNET=172.25.0.0/16  # DNS relay will be at 172.25.0.200
```

## 3. Deploy the Application

Choose one of the following paths based on whether you need GPU acceleration.

### Option A: CPU Deployment

Deploy the Smart Traffic Intersection Agent with Trusted Compute enabled on CPU:

```bash
# Deploy with Trusted Compute enabled
export ENABLE_TC=true
source ./setup.sh --setup
```

This single command will:

- Set required environment variables with default values
- Set up dependencies required for Smart Traffic Intersection Agent
- Generate the required TLS certificates and authentication files
- Download demo video files for testing
- Build Docker images
- Start services in the Smart Traffic Intersection Agent's application stack with Trusted Compute enabled

### Option B: GPU Deployment

#### Step 1: Bind GPU to vfio-pci

> **Note:** Binding the GPU stops the display manager and disables the graphical display on the host. Run this step over SSH. The display is restored after running the `unbind` command.

Use the `intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh` script from the `tools/` directory of the Trusted Compute package installed in [Step 1](#1-install-trusted-compute) to bind the Intel iGPU to the `vfio-pci` driver.

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh bind
```

Verify the GPU is bound correctly:

```bash
lspci -nnk -d 8086: | grep -A 3 "VGA\|Display"
```

The output should show `Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci` for your Intel GPU.

#### Step 2: Deploy with GPU Enabled

```bash
# Deploy with Trusted Compute and GPU enabled
export ENABLE_TC=true
export VLM_TARGET_DEVICE=GPU
source ./setup.sh --setup
```

#### Run Alternative Setup Options

For a more granular control, run these commands:

```bash
#  Set environment variables without building image or starting any containers
source setup.sh --setenv

# Build service images only (without starting containers)
source setup.sh --build

# Start services without building the image
source setup.sh --run

# Stop services
source setup.sh --stop

# Restart services. The variable `service_type` can be set to `agent`, `deps`, and `all`. Run with --help to get details of each type.
source setup.sh --restart [service_type]

# Clean up containers. Run with --help to get details of the option.
source setup.sh --clean [option]
```

## 4. Accessing the Services

After the setup process completes, the URLs for all services are displayed on the terminal.
You can get the URL for **Traffic Intersection Agent UI** and **Traffic Intersection Agent API Docs**
from the response, and access it in a web browser.

The following is a sample response that you might get at script completion, which displays the
URLs for accessing the relevant services:

## Advanced Configuration and Operations

For advanced configuration options and operational tasks, refer to the following sections in the Get Started guide:

- **[Running Multiple Instances](./get-started.md#running-multiple-instances-test-or-development-only)**: Set up multiple STIA instances for testing or development purposes
- **[Advanced Environment Configuration](./get-started.md#advanced-environment-configuration)**: Customize environment variables and configuration settings
- **[Upgrading](./get-started.md#upgrading)**: Update to newer versions of STIA
- **[Troubleshooting](./get-started.md#troubleshooting)**: Common issues and solutions

## 5. Clean Up the Deployment

Follow the steps below in order to cleanly remove the deployment.

**Step 1. Stop and Remove the Containers:**

To stop and remove the Smart Traffic Intersection Agent containers:

```bash
source ./setup.sh --clean
```

**Step 2. Revert GPU Binding** (if deployed with GPU):

On each host where the GPU was bound, unbind it from vfio-pci:

```bash
sudo ./tools/intel-igpu-vfio-bind.sh unbind
```

This will restore the display manager and graphical display on the host.

**Step 3. Uninstall Trusted Compute** (optional):

To uninstall Trusted Compute from the host, refer to the [Trusted Compute documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/trusted-compute/blob/main/docs/trusted_compute_baremetal.md).

## Other Deployment Options

For Kubernetes-based deployments with Trusted Compute:

- **[Deploy with Helm and Trusted Compute](./get-started/deploy-with-trusted-compute-helm.md)**: Use Helm to deploy the application with Trusted Compute to a Kubernetes cluster for scalable and production-ready deployments with hardware isolation.
