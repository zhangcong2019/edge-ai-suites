# Video search — find moments in an archive → vss

**User (business objective):**
> I have hundreds of recorded videos and want to type "forklift near a person"
> and jump to the matching clips.

**Orchestrator (Step 1 — business Q&A):**
1. Outcome — natural-language search that returns ranked clips? [yes]
2. Inputs — a folder/library of MP4s to index? [yes, provide path]
3. Also want auto-summaries of videos, or search only? [search only]
4. Deployment — Docker or Kubernetes? [Docker]
5. Hardware — Intel CPU only, or GPU/vLLM available? [CPU]

**Discovery (Step 2):** verb *search* + object *video library* → primary
**`vss-deploy`** (search mode), supporting **`vdms-dataprep-user`** (ingest) and
**`vss-search-index`** (query). k8s → `vss-deploy-helm`. Add
`vss-summarize-video` only if summaries were requested.

**Plan (Step 4 — awaits confirmation):**
- Deliverable: VSS app in **search** mode via Docker Compose; the library
  ingested and indexed; a working natural-language query returning ranked clips.
- Skills (sequence): `vdms-dataprep-user` (ingest) → `vss-deploy` (`--search`) →
  `vss-search-index` (query).
- Inferred technology: OpenVINO CPU, multimodal embeddings, VDMS vector DB.
- Install (after approval):
  `npx skills add open-edge-platform/skills --skill vss-deploy`
  (and `vdms-dataprep-user`, `vss-search-index`).
- Requirements: Docker + Compose v2; disk for the video library + vectors.

**Build (Step 5, after approval):** ingest with `vdms-dataprep-user`, deploy with
`vss-deploy --search`, run a sample query with `vss-search-index`, then hand the
user the search UI/endpoint.
