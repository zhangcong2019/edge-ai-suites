# Build from Source

This guide shows how to build the Live Video Captioning RAG sample application from the source.

## Build the Image

1. Ensure you are in the project directory:

     ```bash
     cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/live-video-analysis/live-video-captioning-rag
     ```

2. (Optional) To include third-party copyleft source packages in the built images, export the environment variable before building:

     ```bash
     export COPYLEFT_SOURCES=true
     ```

3. Generate the environment file:

     ```bash
     # Generate .env from .env.example.
     # To customize models or device, edit .env after running this command.
     bash scripts/setup_env.sh
     ```

4. Build the Docker image:

     ```bash
     docker compose build
     ```
