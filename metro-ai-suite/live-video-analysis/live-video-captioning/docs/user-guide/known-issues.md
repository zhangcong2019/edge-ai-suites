# Known Issues

## NPU high-resolution inference may require token-length tuning

Symptoms:

- With `NPU` selected as the VLM device, higher frame resolutions can fail to start, fail during runtime, if token-length limits are too low for the input.

Details:

- The NPU LLM pipeline uses a static-shape approach that optimizes execution performance, but it can introduce usage limitations for larger prompt/image token inputs.
- By default, the NPU pipeline supports input prompts up to `1024` tokens and ensures a generated response of at least `128` tokens, unless generation reaches the end-of-sequence (EOS) token or a lower response limit is explicitly configured.
- Prompt and response length options:
  - `MAX_PROMPT_LEN`: maximum number of input prompt tokens the pipeline can process (default: `1024`).
  - `MIN_RESPONSE_LEN`: minimum number of response tokens the pipeline will generate (default: `128`).
- In this application, these options are configured through:
  - `NPU_MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH` (maps to `MAX_PROMPT_LEN`)
  - `NPU_MIN_RESPONSE_LENGTH` (maps to `MIN_RESPONSE_LEN`)
- For higher-resolution frames, you may need a larger `NPU_MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH` so the prompt/image tokens fit.

Impact:

- Increasing `NPU_MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH` to support higher-resolution inference typically increases generation cost and latency, including higher Time To First Token (TTFT) and slower end-to-end response time.
- Raising `NPU_MIN_RESPONSE_LENGTH` can further increase decode time because the model is encouraged to generate more tokens before stopping.

## Pipeline server exits with 2 GPU streams

Symptoms:

- When two GPU pipeline streams are started, the pipeline server exits from the container.

Hardware:

- Issue observed on BMG-580 discrete GPU.

## Video resolution and stream characteristics reduce concurrent stream capacity

Symptoms:

- Starting additional streams may fail, stall, or cause unstable behavior when resolution/FPS/bitrate is high.
- The practical number of concurrent streams is lower than expected, especially on larger VLMs or when using higher input resolutions.
- Under heavy workloads, the pipeline server may hit out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and terminate with a segmentation fault.

Details:

- Concurrent stream capacity depends on combined workload, not stream count alone.
- Higher frame resolution, higher frame rate, larger chunk size, and more complex scenes increase per-stream compute and memory pressure.
- Upscaling source frames before VLM inference may increase latency and reduce the number of stable concurrent streams.
- WebRTC re-streaming of 2K/4K video to the dashboard also consumes significant compute resources, which can further reduce stable concurrent stream capacity.

Guidance:

- Start with `Frame Resolution=Default` so the source stream resolution is used as-is.
- If stability or throughput degrades, downscale resolution first (for example, 640×480), then reduce frame rate/chunk size.
- Scale streams gradually and validate latency/throughput at each step.
- If `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` exits unexpectedly, stop and restart the deployment.

## RTSP Stream not reachable from Live Video Captioning Application

Symptoms:

- Stream not able to play or pipeline not able to start
- DLSPS container shows logs as below:

     ```text
     dlstreamer-pipeline-server  | 0:01:06.194223369     8 0x7060180012c0 ERROR           default gstrtspconnection.c:1291:gst_rtsp_connection_connect_with_response_usec: failed to connect: Could not connect to 10.102.14.14: Socket I/O timed out
     ```

Checks:

- Include rtsp stream ip in no_proxy environment variable.

## Pipeline server core dump sometimes

Symptoms:

- New pipelines cannot be created after pipeline server exits.
- Logs show the pipeline server core-dumping.

Details:

- This issue appears to be caused by resource pressure or instability in the pipeline server rather than in the live-video-captioning application itself.

Checks:

- Verify the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` service is running.
- Restart the pipeline server or the full application stack if the service is not running.

Tip:

- Size the number of streams according to the available hardware resources.

## Proxy and no_proxy configuration (mandatory)

Behind a corporate network, incorrect proxy settings are the most common cause of model-download failures and DL Streamer Pipeline Server crashes. Make sure both the Docker daemon proxy and `no_proxy` are set correctly and kept consistent.

Docker daemon proxy (required for internet access during model download):

- Configure the proxy for the Docker daemon.
- Restart Docker after updating:

  ```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```

`no_proxy` (required so DLSPS does not crash):

- Add the required entries in `/etc/environment`, including your local network ranges:

  ```bash
  no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,<add-local-network-ranges>
  ```

- Reload the environment:

  ```bash
  source /etc/environment
  ```
Note:

- On an open network (no proxy), remove the proxy settings from the DLSPS (`dlstreamer-pipeline-server`) service in `compose.yaml`. This is a known bug and will be fixed soon.

## DLSPS segfault from improper proxy configuration

Symptoms:

- Pipeline server failure.
- Segmentation fault in the DLSPS (DL Streamer Pipeline Server) container.

Details:

- Improper or inconsistent proxy configuration can lead to segmentation faults in DLSPS.

Workarounds:

- Ensure both the Docker daemon proxy and `no_proxy` are configured correctly (see the proxy configuration issue above).
- Avoid inconsistent proxy settings in `compose.yaml`.
- Restart the containers after any configuration change.

## Memory deallocation issue on Panther Lake (PTL)

Impact:

- On Panther Lake (PTL) systems, DLSPS may have memory deallocation issues, leading to pipeline instability over time.

Mitigation:

- Restart the services if instability is observed.
- Monitor memory usage during long runs.

## WebRTC connectivity issues

Symptoms:

- Black video, no stream, or connection failures in the dashboard.

Checks:

- Verify `HOST_IP` in `.env` is reachable from the browser client.
- Confirm firewall rules allow the configured ports.

## Camera not supported (hardware-encoded webcam format)

Symptoms:

- USB/webcam input cannot be started for specific camera devices.

Details:

- Some webcams expose hardware-encoded formats (for example H.264) instead of raw formats expected by this application.

Checks:

- Use a compatible webcam that provides raw video output (for example, YUYV or MJEPG).

## No models in dropdown

Symptoms:

- Model list is empty in the UI.

Checks:

- Ensure `ov_models/` contains at least one model directory with OpenVINO IR files.
- If you downloaded models, re-run the stack so the service rescans.

## Pipeline server unreachable

Symptoms:

- Starting a run fails; backend reports it cannot reach the pipeline server.

Checks:

- Ensure the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` service is running.
- Verify `PIPELINE_SERVER_URL` (defaults to `http://dlstreamer-pipeline-server:8080`).

## Port conflicts

If the dashboard or APIs are not reachable, check whether the ports are already in use and update the `.env` values (for example `DASHBOARD_PORT`).

## Performance/throughput lower than expected

- Larger VLMs require more compute and memory; try a smaller model.
- Reduce `max_tokens`.
- Ensure hardware acceleration and drivers are installed if using GPU.

## Metrics graphs lag on GPU pipelines when running in Helm Deployments

Symptoms:

- Live metrics graphs in the dashboard trail behind real-time by a few seconds intermittently when the pipeline is running on a GPU node.

Details:

- The lag is a display artifact caused by the metrics-manager Telegraf `inputs.exec` plugin taking longer than expected to gather CPU frequency data on high-core-count GPU nodes (e.g. nodes with 192 CPUs). This can cause metric batches to queue up and be flushed slightly out of sync.
- The pipeline inference and captioning are unaffected; only the metrics visualization is delayed.

## Gemma model not working in GPU

- Gemma model is not working on GPU. Only working on CPU.

## Limited testing on EMT-S and EMT-D

- This release includes only limited testing on EMT‑S and EMT‑D, some behaviors may not yet be fully validated across all scenarios.

## PVCs bound to local storage prevent reinstall on a different worker node

If the cluster default `StorageClass` uses node-local storage (for example `local-path`), the PersistentVolumes backing the model PVCs are physically stored on the node where the chart was first installed.
When `keepPvc` is `true` (the default), uninstalling the chart preserves the PVCs.
If you then reinstall the chart targeting a different worker node (`global.nodeName`), the pods will remain in `Pending` because the existing PVs are only accessible from the original node.

Workaround — choose one of the following:

- **Delete the old PVCs** before reinstalling on a different node:

  ```bash
  kubectl delete pvc <release>-live-video-captioning-models
  kubectl delete pvc <release>-live-video-captioning-detection-models
  ```

  The model-download hook will repopulate the PVCs on the new node.

- **Set `keepPvc` to `false`** in your override values so Helm deletes and recreates the PVCs on every install:

  ```yaml
  modelsPvc:
    keepPvc: false
  detectionModelsPvc:
    keepPvc: false
  ```

- **Use a network-attached `StorageClass`** (for example NFS, Ceph, or Longhorn) by setting `global.storageClassName` so that PVs are accessible from any node.

## Known EMT Limitation with External RTSP Streams

Due to an EMT networking limitation, RTSP streams must be deployed within the same Docker network as the application (accessed via container/service name). RTSP streams hosted outside the Docker network or accessed using <host-ip> are not supported.
