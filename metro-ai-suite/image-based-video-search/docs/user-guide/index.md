Image-based Video Search sample application performs near real-time analysis and image-based search to detect and retrieve
objects of interest in large video datasets.

## Overview

This sample application lets users search live or recorded camera feeds
by providing an image and view matching objects with location, timestamp,
and confidence score details.

This sample provides a working example of how to combine edge AI microservices
for video ingestion, object detection, feature extraction, and vector-based
search.

You can use this foundation to build solutions for diverse use cases, including
city infrastructure monitoring and security applications, helping operators
quickly locate objects of interest across large video datasets.

## How it Works

The application workflow consists of three stages: inputs, processing, and outputs.

### Inputs

- Video files or live camera streams (simulated or real time)
- User-provided images or images captured from video for search

The application includes a demonstration video for testing. The video loops
continuously and appears in the UI as soon as the application starts.

### Processing

- **Nginx reverse proxy server**: All interactions with user happens via Nginx server. It protects the IBVS app by handling SSL/TLS encryption, filtering and validating requests, offering centralized access control and making the app directly inaccessible from external access.
- **Video analysis with Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server and MediaMTX**:
  Select **Analyze Stream** to start the DL Streamer Pipeline Server pipeline.
  The Pipeline Server processes video through **MediaMTX**, which simulates
  remote video cameras and publishes live streams. The Pipeline Server extracts
  frames from RTSP streams and detects objects in each frame, publishing predictions through
  **MQTT**.
- **Feature extraction with Feature Matching**: DL Streamer Pipeline Server
  sends metadata and images through MQTT to the Feature Matching microservice.
  Feature Matching generates feature vectors. If predictions exceed the
  threshold, the system stores vector embeddings in MilvusDB and saves frames in
  the Docker file system.
- **Storage and retrieval in MilvusDB**: MilvusDB stores feature vectors. You
  can review them in MilvusUI.
- **Video search with ImageIngestor**: To search, first analyze the stream by
  selecting **Analyze Stream**. Then upload an image or capture an object from
  the video using **Upload Image** or **Capture Frame**. You can adjust the
  frame to capture a specific object. The system ingests images via
  ImageIngestor, processes them with DL Streamer Pipeline Server, and matches
  them against stored feature vectors in MilvusDB.

### Outputs

- Matched search results, including metadata, timestamps, confidence scores, and
  frames
