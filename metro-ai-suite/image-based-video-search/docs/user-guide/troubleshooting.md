## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Containers Not Starting**

   - **Issue**: The application containers fail to start.

   - **Solution**:

     ```bash
     docker compose logs
     ```

   Check the logs for errors and resolve dependency issues.

2. **Port Conflicts**

   - **Issue**: Port conflicts with other running applications.

   - **Solution**: Update the ports section in the Docker Compose file.

3. **`ibvs-milvusdb` container is unhealthy**

   - **Issue**: `ibvs-milvusdb` container fails to start.

   - **Solution**:

     Currently, milvusdb does not work with proxy servers. Make sure that the proxies `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` are set to empty string in `compose.yml` file.

4. **Empty search results after clicking on `Search Object`**

   - **Issue**: Search results are empty after clicking on `Search Object` button.

   - **Solution**:

     - Make sure the models are able to detect the objects in the stream correctly
     - Make sure you have analysed the stream first to capture the video frames into milvus database
     - Make sure you are using the right frame to search the object
     - Increase the 'To' timestamp in the search results to accommodate the latest results

5. **Failure to launch `ibvs-app`, `ibvs-featurematching` or `ibvs-streaming` containers**

   - **Issue**: One of the above containers fails to come up.

   - **Solution**:

     Try building the image locally as mentioned in Step 2 of
     [Set up and First Use](./get-started.md#set-up-and-first-use) before bringing up the containers.

## Troubleshooting Helm Deployments

1. **Helm Chart Not Found**

   - Check if the Helm repository was added:

     ```bash
     helm repo list
     ```

2. **Pods Not Running**:

   - Review pod logs:

     ```bash
     kubectl logs {{pod-name}} -n {{namespace}}
     ```

3. **Service Unreachable**:

   - Confirm the service configuration:

     ```bash
     kubectl get svc -n {{namespace}}
     ```
