# Metro AI Suite

The **Metro AI Suite** accelerates application development for sophisticated edge AI video safety, security, and smart city use cases.

The Metro AI Suite includes Intel® software such as OpenVINO&trade; toolkit, Deep Learning Streamer, Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkit, and other tools, libraries, and microservices for media analytics and AI performance optimization for the aforementioned use cases.

It includes the following tools and toolkits:
- [Metro AI Suite SDK](https://builders.intel.com/intel-technologies/software/edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite#developer-tools): Provides a comprehensive and modular toolkit for accelerated media processing and AI inference, designed to fast-track the development of visual AI solutions.
- [Visual Pipeline and Performance Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/release-2026.2.0/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool): Assess Intel® hardware options, benchmark performance, and analyze key metrics to optimize hardware selection for AI workloads.
- [System Qualification Tool (ESQ)](https://builders.intel.com/ecosystem-engagement/solution-hub/systems/edge-systems-qualification/ai-edge-systems):
a tool mostly for system manufacturers to verify and benchmark hardware performance and
generate system qualification reports. It also enables showcasing high-performing products
as part of the [recommended hardware catalog](https://builders.intel.com/ecosystem-engagement/solution-hub/edge-ai-catalog/partner-spotlight?checkTracking=&type=system).



The Suite also provides a collection of visual analytics sample applications, using deep learning and large models (generative AI):
