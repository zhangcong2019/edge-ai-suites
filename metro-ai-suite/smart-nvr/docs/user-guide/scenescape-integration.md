# Integrate Scenescape with Smart NVR

This guide describes how to integrate Intel® SceneScape with Smart NVR for enhanced traffic monitoring using live data from the Smart Intersection application.

## Overview

Smart NVR integrates with Intel® SceneScape to enable:

- Real-time object counting and tracking (vehicles, pedestrians)
- Traffic flow analysis
- Automated event routing based on count thresholds
- Enhanced surveillance for smart intersection management

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- VSS (Video Search and Summarization) running and reachable from the NVR machine

## Deployment Modes

Smart NVR with SceneScape supports two deployment modes:

| Mode | Description | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Single-Node** | All services (SI + NVR) on one machine | `source setup.sh start` |
| **Distributed Node** | SI on System 1, NVR on System 2 | `source setup.sh start-si` / `source setup.sh start-nvr` |

## Single-Node Deployment

In single-node mode, all services run on one machine. The setup script performs the following steps automatically:

1. Validates required environment variables
2. Configures DL Streamer and Frigate for SceneScape mode
3. Downloads demo videos and starts the MediaMTX RTSP streamer
4. Starts the Smart Intersection stack (runs `install.sh` on first launch)
5. Starts the NVR stack and connects it to the SceneScape network

### Set Environment Variables

```bash
export NVR_SCENESCAPE=true
export VSS_IP=<vss_ip>
export VSS_PORT=<vss_port>                        # optional, default 12345
# export RTSP_STREAM_PORT=<rtsp port>      # optional, default 8554
# export MQTT_USER=<mqtt-username>         # optional, auto-generated if omitted
# export MQTT_PASSWORD=<mqtt-password>     # optional, auto-generated if omitted
```

### Start

```bash
source setup.sh start
```

### Verify

```bash
docker logs nvr-event-router | grep -i "scenescape\|subscribed"
# Expected:
#   Scenescape mode: starting multi-broker manager
#   [si1] subscribed to scenescape/data/camera/# at <host>:1883
```

The UI is available at `http://<host_ip>:7860`.

## Distributed Node Deployment

For distributed deployments where Smart Intersection runs on a dedicated machine
(System 1) and the NVR stack runs on a separate machine (System 2), see
[Multiple SceneScape Deployment](./multi-broker-scenescape.md).

## Stop Services

```bash
source setup.sh stop     # stop all services
source setup.sh restart  # restart all services
```

For distributed node stop commands, see [Multiple SceneScape Deployment](./multi-broker-scenescape.md#stop).

## Verify Integration

```bash
docker logs nvr-event-router | grep -i "scenescape\|subscribed"
# Expected:
#   Scenescape mode: starting multi-broker manager
#   [si1] subscribed to scenescape/data/camera/# at <host>:1883
```

## User Interface

### With Intel® SceneScape Enabled

![SceneScape Enabled Interface](./_assets/Scenescape_enabled.png)

When Intel® SceneScape is enabled (`NVR_SCENESCAPE=true`):

- Source dropdown shows only **"scenescape"** (Frigate source is not available in this mode)
- **Count** field is visible and editable
- Minimum count threshold for rule triggering can be configured (e.g., 5, 10, 15)
- Rules table includes a "Count" column for tracking thresholds
- Count validation enforces non-negative integers

## Auto-Route Events Configuration

### Creating Rules

1. Navigate to the **Auto-Route Events** tab
2. **Source** is pre-set to "scenescape"
3. **Set Count:** Define the minimum detection threshold (e.g., 5)
4. **Select Camera:** Choose the target camera
5. **Choose Detection Label:** Select the object type ("vehicle" or "pedestrian")
6. **Select Action:** Choose "Summarize" or "Add to Search"
7. Click **Add Rule**

### Rule Behavior Example

```text
Source: scenescape
Camera: camera1
Count: 5
Label: vehicle
Action: Summarize
```

This rule triggers video summarization when 5 or more vehicles are detected in camera1.

## Troubleshooting

**SceneScape features not visible in UI**

Verify that `NVR_SCENESCAPE` is set to `true` and restart the services:

```bash
echo $NVR_SCENESCAPE
export NVR_SCENESCAPE=true
source setup.sh restart
```

After restarting, perform a hard refresh in the browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`).

**No SceneScape events received**

```bash
# Check MQTT connectivity to the SceneScape broker
docker logs nvr-event-router | grep -i scenescape

# Verify Smart Intersection containers are running
docker ps | grep metro-vision-ai-app-recipe
```

**Diagnostic commands**

```bash
# Monitor live SceneScape MQTT messages
docker logs nvr-event-router -f | grep "scenescape"

# List all running containers with status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# Check container resource utilization
docker stats --no-stream --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}"
```

## Support

When reporting issues, verify the following:

1. **Environment variables** — Confirm all required variables are exported: `env | grep -E "NVR_|SCENESCAPE|MQTT|VSS"`
2. **MQTT connectivity** — Check logs for: `[si1] subscribed to scenescape/data/camera/#`
3. **Smart Intersection** — Confirm SI containers are running: `docker ps | grep metro`
4. **Distributed node** — See [Multiple SceneScape Deployment](./multi-broker-scenescape.md) for connectivity and broker troubleshooting.
5. **Resource utilization** — Run `docker stats --no-stream` to identify resource-constrained containers

For general Smart NVR issues, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md).
