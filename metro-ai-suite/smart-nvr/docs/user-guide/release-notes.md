## Current Release

### Version 2026.2.0

**Aug 4, 2026**

**New**

- Distributed, multi-broker deployment: Smart NVR can now connect to multiple independent MQTT brokers at once, running side-by-side with SceneScape (Smart Intersection) in a dual-mode configuration. Adds `brokers` and `vss` REST API endpoints for managing this.
- Single-command startup: `setup.sh` now brings up the full stack (RTSP streamer, SceneScape, NVR event-router) in one command, including automatic network joining.
- Migrated Python dependency management from Poetry to `uv`.
- Added multi-broker SceneScape integration and advanced configuration guides.

**Improved**

- Event-processing pipeline no longer blocks the UI during high event volume: summarization and search-embedding calls now run on background threads, and rule summaries are fetched concurrently instead of serially.
- - Continuous camera ingestion now uploads videos through Pipeline Manager and
  submits their search embeddings through asynchronous DataPrep batch jobs.
- Added configurable watcher batch size, job polling interval, and job timeout
  settings for Docker Compose and Helm deployments.

**Fixed**

- Fixed MQTT broker TLS/certificate handling in SceneScape dual-mode by migrating the MQTT client to `aiomqtt`, removing an unnecessary client-certificate requirement.

**Known Issues**

- Scenescape integration is currently not supported when deploying with Helm charts.
- Smart NVR will not work on either Standalone or Developer Node versions of Edge Microvisor Toolkit due to its incompatibility with Frigate.
- The AI-Powered Event Viewer feature relies on Frigate GenAI features, which may exhibit instability or bugs, impacting event data processing reliability.

**Improved**

- Documentation updates to improve clarity and accuracy.

**Fixed**
