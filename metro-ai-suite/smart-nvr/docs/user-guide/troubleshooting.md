# Troubleshooting

This page provides comprehensive support and troubleshooting information for the Smart NVR Sample Application. It is divided into the following sections:

- [Common Issues](#common-issues): General troubleshooting steps for resolving issues like container failures, port conflicts, and missing dependencies.
- [Troubleshooting Docker Deployments](#troubleshooting-docker-deployments): Steps to address problems specific to Docker deployments.

If you encounter any problems with the application not addressed here, check the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/issues) board. Feel free
to file new tickets there (after learning about the guidelines for [Contributing](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/release-2026.2.0/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Common Issues

### 1. GenAI Event Descriptions Not Working

- **Issue**: AI-powered event descriptions are not being generated or displayed.
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure `NVR_GENAI=true` environment variable is set before starting the application
  - Verify the Frigate configuration file has `genai.enabled: true`
  - Check VLM microservice logs for connectivity issues: `docker logs <vlm-container-id>`
  - Verify the model specified in Frigate config matches the one deployed in VLM service

> **Note:** This is an experimental feature with known stability issues

### 2. Object not getting detected

- Check the label in Frigate `config.yaml` for the specific camera.
- Check the `top_score` parameter .

### 3. "No video footage available" warning during Summarize/Search Clip

- Ensure the browser’s date and time are correctly set and in sync with the system time of the machine running the NVR services.
- Video clips are only available from the time the NVR services started running. If a past time (before service start) is selected, this warning will be shown.

## Troubleshooting Docker Deployments

### 1. Containers Failing

- Check the Docker logs for errors:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker logs <container-id>
   ```

### 2. Port Conflicts in Docker

- Update the `ports` section in the Compose file to resolve conflicts.

### 3. Reset Application

- Follow these steps to reset the application to the initial state

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh stop
   docker volume rm docker_mosquitto_data docker_mosquitto_log docker_redis_data
   ```
