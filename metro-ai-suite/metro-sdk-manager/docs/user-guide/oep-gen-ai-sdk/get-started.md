# Getting Started Guide - OEP Gen AI SDK

## Overview

The OEP Gen AI SDK provides a comprehensive development environment for generative AI applications using Intel's optimized tools and microservices. This guide demonstrates the installation process and provides a practical question-answering implementation using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this guide, you will be able to:

- Install and configure the OEP Gen AI SDK
- Deploy generative AI microservices for document processing and question-answering
- Understand the architecture of RAG-based applications using Intel's AI frameworks

## System Requirements

Verify that your development environment meets the following specifications:

- Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Memory: Minimum 64GB RAM (recommended for LLM operations)
- Storage: 100GB available disk space for models and data
- Network: Active internet connection for package downloads

## Installation Process

Execute the automated installation script to configure the complete development environment:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/refs/heads/release-2026.2.0/metro-ai-suite/metro-sdk-manager/scripts/oep-gen-ai-sdk.sh | bash
```

## Question-Answering Application Implementation

This section demonstrates a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application workflow using the installed Gen AI components.

### Step 1: Setup Model Download Service

Configure and start the Model Download service to manage LLM and embedding model downloads:

```bash
cd $HOME/oep/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/model-download
export REGISTRY="intel/"
export TAG=latest
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
source scripts/run_service.sh up --plugins openvino --model-path $HOME/oep/models/
```

> **Note:** Keep this terminal open while the model download service is running. Open a new terminal to continue with the next steps.

Update the `<your-huggingface-token>` to your Access Token from Hugging Face. To learn more, follow this [guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).

### Step 2: Configure Environment and Dependencies

Set up the Python virtual environment and install required dependencies:

```bash
cd $HOME/oep/edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer
# Configure application environment variables
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
export LLM_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
export EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5
export RERANKER_MODEL=BAAI/bge-reranker-base
export DEVICE="CPU"
export REGISTRY="intel/"
export TAG=latest
export MODEL_DOWNLOAD_HOST=localhost
export MODEL_DOWNLOAD_PORT=8200
source setup.sh llm=OVMS embed=OVMS
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Application

Start the complete Gen AI application stack using Docker Compose:

```bash
export ALLOWED_HOSTS="*.intel.com,en.wikipedia.org,*.wikipedia.org,*.github.com"
docker compose up
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment Status

Run below command in another terminal to check that all application components are running correctly:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Step 5: Access the Application Interface

Open a web browser and navigate to the application dashboard:

```bash
http://localhost:8101
```
