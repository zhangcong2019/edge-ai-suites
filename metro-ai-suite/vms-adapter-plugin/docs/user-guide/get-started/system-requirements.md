# System Requirements

The VMS Adapter Plugin itself is a lightweight orchestration service. Hardware requirements
scale with the number of cameras and the AI Analytics Applications running alongside it (Live
Video Captioning or DL Streamer Vision application like Loitering Detection) — refer to those
applications' system requirements for GPU/NPU needs. The system requirements of the used
analytics determine the platforms more than VAP itself. The documentation here, hence, should
be calibrated depending on the analytics used.

## Supported Platforms

**Operating Systems**:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

**Hardware Platforms**:

## Network / Ports

Default ports (configurable via `.env`):

| PostgreSQL           | `5433`           | Internal database (host-mapped)      |

> **Note:** Ensure these ports are not in use by other services before starting the stack.

## Connected Service Requirements

The following external services must be reachable from the VAP backend container at startup:

| **Service**                              | **Required For**                | **Default Port** |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Live Video Captioning (LVC)              | LVC Analytics App integration   | `4173`           |
| MediaMTX (WebRTC signaling)              | Live stream relay to UI         | `8889`           |
| Nx Witness                               | Nx VMS camera discovery         | `7001` (HTTPS)   |
| DL Streamer Pipeline Server (dls_vision) | DL Streamer Vision              | `8080`           |
| MQTT Broker                              | `dls_vision` metadata streaming | `1883`           |

## Validation

Proceed to [Get Started](../get-started.md) once Docker is installed and your VMS and Analytics App services are reachable.
