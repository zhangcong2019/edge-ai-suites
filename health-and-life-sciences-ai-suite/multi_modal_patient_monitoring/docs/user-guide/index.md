::::

The Multi-Modal Patient Monitoring application is a reference solution that demonstrates how
multiple AI pipelines can run simultaneously on a single Intel® platform, providing
workflows that mimic a consolidated patient monitoring application.

It combines several representative AI workloads and services:

- **rPPG (Remote Photoplethysmography):** Contactless heart and respiratory rate estimation
  from facial video.
- **3D-Pose Estimation:** 3D human pose detection from video.
- **AI-ECG:** ECG rhythm classification from simulated ECG waveforms.
- **MDPNP (Medical Device Plug-and-Play):** Getting metrics of three simulated devices such
  as ECG, BP and CO2.
- **Patient Monitoring Aggregator:** Central service that collects and aggregates vitals from
  all AI workloads.
- **Metrics Collector:** Gathers hardware and system telemetry (CPU, GPU, NPU, power) from
  the host.
- **UI:** Web-based dashboard for visualizing waveforms, numeric vitals, and system status.

Together, these components illustrate how vision- and signal-based AI workloads can be
orchestrated, monitored, and visualized in a clinical-style scenario.
