::::

The NICU Warmer application is a reference solution that demonstrates how multiple AI models
can run simultaneously in a single GStreamer pipeline on Intel® hardware, providing workloads
that mimic real-time neonatal patient monitoring in a simulated hospital warmer bed scenario.

It combines several representative AI workloads:

- **Object Detection (×3):** Custom OpenVINO FP32 models for detecting patient presence,
  caretaker presence, and warmer latch clip status — all running on Intel Arc GPU.
- **rPPG (Remote Photoplethysmography):** Contactless heart and respiratory rate
  estimation from facial video using MTTS-CAN, running on CPU.
- **Action Recognition:** Kinetics-400 encoder/decoder model mapped to 11 NICU-specific
  activity categories, running on Intel NPU (AI Boost).
- **Metrics Collector:** Gathers hardware and system telemetry (CPU, GPU, NPU, memory, power)
  from the host.
- **UI:** Web-based React dashboard for visualizing detections, vital signs, activity, and
  system performance in real time.

Together, these components illustrate how vision-based AI workloads can be orchestrated across
Intel GPU, NPU, and CPU, monitored, and visualized in a clinical-style scenario.
