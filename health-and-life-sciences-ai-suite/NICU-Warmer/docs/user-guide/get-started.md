# Get Started

This guide walks you through cloning the repository, downloading AI models, and running the NICU Warmer application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the [System Requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md) before proceeding.

## 1. Clone the Repository

Use sparse checkout to download only the NICU Warmer component.
If you want to clone a specific release branch, replace `main` with the desired tag.
To learn more on partial cloning, check the [Repository Cloning guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.2/OEP-articles/contribution-guide.html#repository-cloning-partial-cloning).

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch release-2026.2.0 \
  https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
cd edge-ai-suites
git sparse-checkout set health-and-life-sciences-ai-suite/NICU-Warmer
cd health-and-life-sciences-ai-suite/NICU-Warmer
```

## 2. Manual Model Staging

Before running `make run`, stage the workload models in these locations:

- Repository root:
  - patient detection model files: `.xml` and `.bin`
  - person detection model files: `.xml` and `.bin`
  - latch detection model files: `.xml` and `.bin`
  - action recognition encoder model files: `.xml` and `.bin`
  - action recognition decoder model files: `.xml` and `.bin`
- `models_rppg/`:
  - rPPG workload source model: `.hdf5`

`make run` expects these files to exist.

### Example Models

1. Patient Detection Model - [patient-present](https://huggingface.co/Intel/patient-present/tree/main)\*

2. Person Detection Model - [people-present](https://huggingface.co/Intel/people-present/tree/main)\*

3. Latch Detection Model - [latch-detect](https://huggingface.co/Intel/latch-detect/tree/main)\*

   > \*Download the above model artifacts (`.xml` and `.bin`) from Hugging Face and place them in the appropriate    model directory structure. Only these files are required for inference; downloading the remaining repository    contents is optional.

4. RPPG Model - [MTTS-CAN](https://github.com/xliucs/MTTS-CAN/raw/main/mtts_can.hdf5)

5. Action Recognition Models -

   - Action Recognition Encoder (.xml)

     ```bash
     wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/open_model_zoo/temp/action-recognition-0001/action-recognition-0001-encoder/FP16/action-recognition-0001-encoder.xml
     ```

   - Action Recognition Encoder (.bin)

     ```bash
     wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/open_model_zoo/temp/action-recognition-0001/action-recognition-0001-encoder/FP16/action-recognition-0001-encoder.bin
     ```

   - Action Recognition Decoder (.xml)

     ```bash
     wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/open_model_zoo/temp/action-recognition-0001/action-recognition-0001-decoder/FP16/action-recognition-0001-decoder.xml
     ```

   - Action Recognition Decoder (.bin)

     ```bash
     wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/open_model_zoo/temp/action-recognition-0001/action-recognition-0001-decoder/FP16/action-recognition-0001-decoder.bin
     ```

## 3. Prepare Local Assets

Run setup to verify local assets and generate the rPPG OpenVINO IR when needed:

```bash
make setup
```

This step:

- checks the staged model files already present in the repo
- converts `.hdf5` to `.{xml,bin}`
- preserves existing local assets on repeated runs

> **Important**: `make setup` must complete before `make run`. If `docker compose up`
> runs first, Docker creates empty directories for missing bind-mount sources, causing
> pipeline failures.

## 4. Run the Application

Start all services (default mixed-optimized device profile):

```bash
make run
```

By default, `make run` pulls the prebuilt images from Docker Hub.

To build the images locally instead:

```bash
make run REGISTRY=false
```

To pull a specific release tag:

```bash
make run TAG=2026.1.0-rc2
```

This pulls and starts 5 containers:

| Service                  | Port | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `nicu-backend`           | 5001 | Flask API + SSE stream + MQTT subscriber |
| `nicu-ui`                | 3001 | React dashboard (nginx reverse proxy)    |
| `nicu-dlsps`             | 8080 | DL Streamer Pipeline Server (GStreamer)  |
| `nicu-mqtt`              | 1883 | Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker            |
| `nicu-metrics-collector` | 9100 | Hardware telemetry (CPU/GPU/NPU/Memory)  |

### Device Profiles

Select a specific device profile at launch:

```bash
make run           # Mixed-optimized (GPU detect, CPU rPPG, NPU action)
make run-cpu       # All workloads on CPU
make run-gpu       # All workloads on GPU
make run-npu       # All workloads on NPU
```

## 5. Open the Dashboard

Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` in a browser.

Click **Prepare & Run** to start the AI pipeline. The system will:

1. Start the GStreamer pipeline with all 5 models
2. Process video at ~15 FPS
3. Stream detections and vitals via MQTT
4. Display results in real-time on the dashboard

## 6. Stop the Application

Click **Stop** in the dashboard, or from the terminal:

```bash
make down
```

## Troubleshooting

### Empty directories instead of model files

If `make run` was executed before `make setup`, Docker may have created empty
directories for bind-mount paths. Fix:

```bash
make down
sudo rm -rf Warmer_Testbed_YTHD.mp4 model_artifacts models_rppg
make setup
make run
```

### Proxy configuration

If behind a corporate proxy, set environment variables before running:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:port
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:port
export http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY
export https_proxy=$HTTPS_PROXY
```

The compose file forwards these to all containers automatically.
