# Get Started

This guide provides a streamlined path to setting up and running the Deterministic Threat
Detection demonstration. It covers the essential prerequisites and the main steps to see the
system in action.

## How It Works

![DTD High-Level Architecture](./_assets/rtsp-dtd-architecture.svg)

The use case involves multiple RTSP cameras streaming video to edge compute nodes for AI
inference. Simultaneously, a sensor data producer generates telemetry data. Both inference
results and sensor data are published over MQTT.

An aggregation node measures the end-to-end latency. By injecting background traffic and then
enabling TSN features, the demonstration shows how TSN provides consistent and deterministic
latency for critical data streams.

To ensure synchronized operations across all devices, every machine in the system uses Precision Time Protocol (PTP) to align their clocks accurately.

An aggregation node collects the MQTT messages and calculates the end-to-end latency. To demonstrate the impact of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), background traffic is introduced into the network. By enabling TSN features, the system showcases how TSN guarantees consistent and deterministic latency for critical data streams, even under network congestion.


## System Requirements

See [System Requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md) for the full list of software and hardware prerequisites.

## Network Topology

![TSN Network Topology](./_assets/rtsp-dtd-network-topology.svg)

The experimental setup consists of:

- **2 × [AXIS RTSP Camera P3265-LVE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-p3265-lve/support)**
- **1 × [Moxa Managed Switch TSN-G5000 Series](https://www.moxa.com/getmedia/a0db0ef9-2741-4bad-91c6-1ec1827aca64/moxa-tsn-g5000-series-web-console-manual-v2.3.pdf)**
- **5 × Arrow Lake Linux Machines with `Intel i226` TSN network cards**

### Logical Roles

| Machine | Role |
|---------|------|
| Machine 1 | Camera 1 RTSP Capture + AI Inference |
| Machine 2 | Camera 2 RTSP Capture + AI Inference |
| Machine 3 | Sensor Data Producer (MQTT) |
| Machine 4 | MQTT Aggregator + Visualization |
| Machine 5 | Traffic Injector (`iperf`) |

All machines are connected to a MOXA switch and synchronized using PTP.

## Steps to Test the Use Case

1. **Configure PTP on all machines.**

   Synchronize the system clocks of all machines to a
   common time reference using Precision Time Protocol (PTP). This is essential for accurate
   latency measurement.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y linuxptp git
   git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxptp/code linuxptp
   cd linuxptp
   # Terminal 1: Run ptp4l to synchronize the PTP clock
   sudo ptp4l -i enp1s0 -f configs/gPTP.cfg --step_threshold=1 -m -s
   # Terminal 2: Run phc2sys to synchronize the system clock to the PTP clock
   sudo phc2sys -s enp1s0 -c CLOCK_REALTIME --step_threshold=1 --transportSpecific=1 -w -m
   ```

   > **Note:** Make sure to replace `enp1s0` with the actual network interface name associated
   > with the `i226` network card.

   For detailed instructions on configuring PTP, refer to the [PTP Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/rtsp-deterministic-inference/configure-ptp-gptp.md).

2. **Create VLAN on all machines.**

   Set up Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segregate network traffic,
   isolating critical data from best-effort traffic.

   > **Note:** Configure the VLAN on the MOXA as mentioned in the
   > [MOXA VLAN Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/common/configure-vlan-on-moxa-switch.md)    to assign VLAN ID on TSN switch.

   On the Arrow Lake machines, create VLAN interfaces corresponding to the VLAN IDs
   configured on the MOXA switch.

   ```bash
   sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.1 type vlan id 1
   sudo ip link set enp1s0.1 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:1
   sudo ifconfig enp1s0.1 192.168.127.31 up

   sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.3 type vlan id 3
   sudo ip link set enp1s0.3 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:3
   sudo ifconfig enp1s0.3 192.168.3.31 up

   sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.5 type vlan id 5
   sudo ip link set enp1s0.5 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:5
   sudo ifconfig enp1s0.5 192.168.5.31 up
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > - Make sure to replace `enp1s0` with the actual network interface name associated
   >   with the `i226` network card.

   For detailed instructions on creating VLANs on HOST machines, refer to the
   [HOST VLAN Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/common/create-vlan-on-all-machines.md).

3. **Run RTSP Camera Capture and AI Inference.**

   Start the video pipeline on Machines 1 and 2. This involves capturing the RTSP stream,
   timestamping frames using the PTP-synchronized clock, and running AI inference on the
   video and publish the results over MQTT.

   For detailed instructions on running RTSP camera capture and AI inference, refer to the
   [RTSP Camera and AI Inference Guide](./how-to-guides/rtsp-deterministic-inference/run-rtsp-camera-and-ai-inference.md).

4. **Run Sensor Data Producer.**

   On Machine 3, start the Python script that simulates a sensor generating and publishing timestamped data over MQTT.

   For detailed instructions on running the sensor data producer, refer to the
   [Sensor Data Producer Guide](./how-to-guides/rtsp-deterministic-inference/run-sensor-data-producer.md).

5. **Run MQTT Aggregator and Visualization.**

   On Machine 4, launch the application that subscribes to the MQTT topics, calculates end-to-end latency, and displays it on a live dashboard.

   ![MQTT Data Aggregator](./_assets/mqtt-data-aggregator.png)

   For detailed instructions on running the MQTT aggregator and visualization, refer to the
   [MQTT Aggregator and Visualization Guide](./how-to-guides/rtsp-deterministic-inference/run-mqtt-aggregator-and-visualization.md).

6. **Run Traffic Injector.**

   On Machine 5, use iPerf3 to generate high-volume background
   traffic to simulate network congestion.

   ![MQTT Data Aggregator With Traffic](./_assets/mqtt-data-aggregator-with-traffic.png)

   For detailed instructions on running the traffic injector, refer to the
   [Traffic Injector Guide](./how-to-guides/rtsp-deterministic-inference/run-traffic-injector.md).

7. **Enable TSN Traffic Shaping.**

   Configure the Time-Aware Shaper (IEEE 802.1Qbv) on the MOXA switch to prioritize the
   critical traffic from cameras and sensors, protecting it from the background traffic.
   ![MOXA Time Aware Shaper](./_assets/moxa-time-aware-shaper-port-setting.png)

   For detailed instructions on enabling TSN traffic shaping, refer to the
   [TSN Traffic Shaping Guide](./how-to-guides/common/enable-tsn-traffic-shaping.md).

8. **Analyze Results and Visualize Latency.**

   Observe the latency graphs on the MQTT Aggregator dashboard. With TSN enabled,
   the latency for critical traffic should remain low and deterministic, even with
   the iPerf3 traffic running.
