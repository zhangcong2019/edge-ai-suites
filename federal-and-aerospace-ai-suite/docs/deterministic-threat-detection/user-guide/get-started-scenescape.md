# Get Started: Scenescape

This guide explains how to run [Scenescape](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/scenescape) on a TSN network and evaluate tracking quality under baseline, congestion, and TSN-shaped conditions. The workflow supports either Basler GigE cameras with IEEE 1588v2 PTP hardware timestamps or RTSP cameras that rely on NTP-based synchronization.

## How It Works

![Scenescape deterministic threat detection architecture](./_assets/scenescape-dtd-architecture.svg)

This use case streams video from either Basler or RTSP cameras through the DL Streamer
Pipeline Server for AI inference (person detection). The Scenescape controller consumes
the inference results and produces 3D multi-camera tracking output. By injecting
background traffic and then enabling TSN features, this demonstration shows how TSN
preserves tracking accuracy even under network congestion — quantified using HOTA,
MOTA, and IDF1 metrics.

## System Requirements

See [System Requirements](./get-started/system-requirements-scenescape.md) for the full list of software and hardware prerequisites.

## Network Topology

![TSN Network Topology](./_assets/scenescape-dtd-network-topology.svg)

The MOXA switch carries both camera traffic and background traffic. In the Basler camera setup, the switch also acts as the PTP Grandmaster for the host and cameras.

### Logical Roles

| Machine | Role |
|---------|------|
| Arrow Lake Host (Machine 1) | Runs Scenescape and the DL Streamer inference pipeline |
| Traffic Injector (Machine 2) | Injects background traffic with `iperf3` to simulate congestion |

## Prerequisite: Clone Scenescape Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/scenescape --branch 2026.1.0
cd scenescape
```

## Prerequisite: Choose Your Camera Setup

### Option 1: RTSP Camera with NTP Synchronization

Scenescape supports NTP-synchronized RTSP cameras by default. Set the following in `scenescape/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/queuing-config.json` for both `qcam1` and `qcam2` pipelines:

```json
"frame_ntp_config": {
    "useFrameNtpTimestamp": true
},
```

### Option 2: Basler Camera with IEEE 1588v2 PTP Synchronization

Basler cameras provide hardware PTP timestamps, but require additional setup for the camera, switch, host, and Scenescape containers.

Before continuing, complete the following steps in order:

1. [Configure MOXA Switch and Host for IEEE 1588v2](./how-to-guides/scenescape-deterministic-inference/configure-ptp-1588v2.md)
2. [Configure the Basler Camera to Use PTP Timestamps](./how-to-guides/scenescape-deterministic-inference/configure-basler-ptp-timestamps.md)
3. [Set Up Scenescape with Basler GigE Camera and PTP Support](./how-to-guides/scenescape-deterministic-inference/integrate-basler-camera-with-scenescape.md)

## End-to-End Testing

### Step 1: Set Up VLANs on the Host

Create VLAN interfaces to isolate critical camera traffic from best-effort traffic on the
TSN switch.

> **Note:** First configure VLAN IDs on the MOXA switch as described in the
> [MOXA VLAN Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/common/configure-vlan-on-moxa-switch.md).

```bash
# Replace enp1s0 with your i226 interface name
sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.1 type vlan id 1
sudo ip link set enp1s0.1 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:1
sudo ifconfig enp1s0.1 192.168.127.31 up

sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.5 type vlan id 5
sudo ip link set enp1s0.5 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:5
sudo ifconfig enp1s0.5 192.168.5.31 up
```

> **Note:** If you are using 1588v2 PTP for the time synchronization, make sure to assign any IP address to the default host interface (e.g., `enp1s0`) that is within the same subnet as the camera and switch to ensure the PTP daemon can discover the Grandmaster over UDP.

For detailed instructions, refer to the
[HOST VLAN Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/common/create-vlan-on-all-machines.md).

### Step 2: Run Scenescape

```bash
cd scenescape
make demo
```

> **Note:** Use the instructions in the [Scenescape prebuilt containers guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/scenescape/blob/2026.1.0/docs/user-guide/how-to-guides/deploy-scenescape-using-prebuilt-containers.md#31-configure-docker-compose-to-use-prebuilt-images) to use the prebuilt images.

> **Basler camera users:** If you completed the Basler prerequisite steps above, the Docker Compose file has already been patched and the custom DL Streamer image with Basler support has been built. Start Scenescape with `make demo` as usual — the patched compose file will be picked up automatically.

### Step 3: Inject Background Traffic

Use iPerf3 to simulate network congestion over VLAN 5. Start an iperf3 server on
Machine 1 and a client on Machine 2:

```bash
# Install iPerf3 on both machines if not already installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y iperf3

# Machine 1 — receive congestion traffic on VLAN 5
iperf3 -s -B <machine1-vlan5-ip>

# Machine 2 — inject UDP traffic toward Machine 1
iperf3 -c <machine1-vlan5-ip> -u -b 960M -t 60
```

Observe the Scenescape controller logs for signs of packet loss and video stream
degradation as best-effort traffic competes with the camera stream. You may also
see visual frame corruption in the camera stream panel of the Scenescape dashboard.

### Step 4: Enable TSN Traffic Shaping

Configure the Time-Aware Shaper (IEEE 802.1Qbv) on the MOXA switch to schedule and
prioritize the camera traffic, protecting it from background congestion.

![MOXA Time Aware Shaper](./_assets/moxa-time-aware-shaper-port-setting.png)

> **Note:** The default MOXA switch username is `admin` and the default password is `moxa`.

> **Note:** Apply the port setting on the switch port that connects to the host running
> Scenescape.

For detailed instructions, refer to the
[TSN Traffic Shaping Guide](./how-to-guides/common/enable-tsn-traffic-shaping.md).

### Step 5: HOTA Metrics and Observability

After validating TSN shaping behavior under load, measure tracking quality and timing
consistency to quantify the end-to-end impact.

Use the HOTA workflow to compare baseline behavior (without shaping) versus TSN-aware
traffic scheduling.

For the full procedure, metric definitions, and example commands, see:

[HOTA Metrics Guide](./how-to-guides/scenescape-deterministic-inference/scenescape-measuring-hota-metrics-with-tsn.md)
